Hotel woth highest altitude in summer, ski-in, ski-out hotel in winter time;5;25.05.2017;Hotel Krvavec is located close to the international airport, to the capital city Ljubljana, 10km from highway and not more than 1 hour by car to reach all other interesting destinations. In winter time is perfect starting location for winter sports as it stands in a middle of ski resort, in summer time location with beautiful nature, great temperature and fresh air to chill down or to do different sports.;Hotel Krvavec;Slovenia;Ski_resort;SloveniaSmucisceHotelKrvavec;Ambroz pod Krvavcem 50, 4207 Cerklje na Gorenjskem, Slovenia;46.3006841;14.5259266
Great skiing holidays!;4;26.03.2017;The hotel located in the middle of a ski resort - absolutely perfect for winnter holidays, easy access to all the slopes with a wide range of difficulty levels, ski school, a snow park, a rental and ski service and restaurants.

Great stay!;4;14.07.2016;"We have spent two days in this hotel in July 2016 and we had a great stay. The hotel is simple but cute, very quiet (I slept like a baby due to the quietness and fresh mountain air). The staff is extremly kind and helpfull (especially Natasa), the surroundings and the nature are very beautifull, you can hike, bike... The food is good but a little bit over priced (this is our only complaint); for example, a simple plate of cooked beans with sausage costs 7,5€. Free Wifi is available at the reception and summer terrace (not in the rooms). The gondola is included in the price of your stay so no need to come all the way up with your car (a car sent by the hotel will pick you up in front of gondola and take you to the hotel, it's a fast ride). All in all, we loved our summer stay in this mountain resort and will come again.";Hotel Krvavec;Slovenia;Ski_resort;SloveniaSmucisceHotelKrvavec;Ambroz pod Krvavcem 50, 4207 Cerklje na Gorenjskem, Slovenia;46.3006841;14.5259266
Another superb break;5;3.04.2016;This was my 3rd visit and once again everyone had a fantastic time. The hotel and location are perfect serving great food. For a 3 day break the skiing is super. Your lift pass is included in the hotel rate which makes it a bargain for skiing. It's a 10minute transfer to the gondola station from the airport and then a jeep meets you at the top to take you to the hotel. Once again Natasa was really helpful in organising everything. I,d highly recommend for a short ski break, I,ve been now with the lads, my son and the family and each trip was excellent.;Hotel Krvavec;Slovenia;Ski_resort;SloveniaSmucisceHotelKrvavec;Ambroz pod Krvavcem 50, 4207 Cerklje na Gorenjskem, Slovenia;46.3006841;14.5259266

charming and cosily;4;25.01.2016;"First to explain how to get there;there is reserved parking place for hotel guest near cable car. Than you go to the cable car on special VIP entrance. People who work there will put your lugagge in cable car. When you get to top, go to the place where they sell ski pass and ask them to call hotel. Hotel will send jeep to pick you up, together with your laguagge.Hotel is small but very charming and very decent three star hotel. Rooms are clean and confortable, bathroom is also clean and good size. Just few rooms have balcony, and you can't pay extra to get it. You just get it or not. Food is tasty and fresh. There is not very big choice for vegeterianas but you can manage it. Hotel offers lunch during the lunch time.There is one waiter whose name is Vid and he is handeling all the problems you can have, everything. He smiles all day and nothing is hard for him, great person. There are three sauna in hotel, two are quite small and one is bigger. The bigger ona has outside windows and you can watch snow falling while you are in sauna. That was very nice.Hotel is right on a ski slopes. Be avare that after 4 o clock all bars except Hotel bar don't work.

great staff, great location, good food;4;16.12.2015;Due to the previous bad experience of myself and my friends I became very anxious after I had not found part of clothes I thought I had brought with me. But the hotel staff was very friendly and checked it for me three times without any complaining. Of course I have found it at home. Guess I'm not used to Slovenian safety) I'm sorry I caused such a trouble.The location is really great and the place itself is cosy with nice rooms under the roof. The view is exellent.

Great as a base for a ski trip, but don't expect luxury. Compensated with great staff!;4;22.02.2015;This place goes under two names it seems, Hotel Raj and Hotel Krvavec (the new one I think).This hotel is placed right on the ski slopes, on the midfdle of the hill. It is great place for a skiing weekend, and altough it has many amenities of a great hotel, there are a lot of details that could be worked on.However, I would still recommend it, just bear in mind this is a mountain cabin, and not luxury hotel.If you plan to spend a day inside, then Rating would be Average (3 dots).We got a double bedroom with extra bed, that was just a matrace on the floor. For us, this was not a problem, but I expect taht a company of older people could have a problem with using it. Room was clean, and properly sized for two people, However, for three persons it was cramped. Good thing is that the room has a lot of cupboard space, enough to fit all the winter and ski luggage of 3.Bathroom was clean and warm, but with a ratchety ventilation that made a noise when turned on - it happened to us in a middle of the night when someone pressed wrong switch trying to turn on the bathroom light and woke up everyone else. Location is excellent for skiing, you exit on the slope from the hotel and you can pracitcally ski into your room. However, bear in mind that this is a top of the mountain, practically inaccessible by road without a 4WD in a snow conditions. You can reach it with cable car only, so be very carefull to get to it during working hours. There is a jeep for a guests that will take you from the top of the cablecar to the hotel.Food is good with several dishes and sidedishes for every meal, including vegetarian options. However, be sure not to show up at the end of the meal time. Hordes of hungry skiers will left the buffet empty. Do not hesistate to ask staff about it if you ran into the empty pots, they will refill it for you, altough you might have fewer options. Be sure to taste the cakes, they are excellent!Since this place is on a top of the mountain, there is not much things to do around it in the evening, buit it has game room with darts, billiards, air hockey and table football, boardgames and such. There is also a basic spa on the premises, containing two small saunas. Altough small, it was not crowded. Book in advance.Hotel has free WiFi, but it does not reach the rooms, only the restaurant and reception area.The staff is great.

Great place to stay;5;12.02.2014;Hotel Krvavec is the highest hotel in Slovenia (1600 metres above sea level).

Worse experiance in my life;1;16.02.2017;The room had no curtains. Shutters have been destroyed to such extent that there were no way to dimm the room. The rest of the room was completely worn out.Upon arrival at the dinner we were sent away. That day apparently, dinner, instead of 19h to 21h, wos served from 16h to 18h. Although we checked in the hotel on the same day at 15h, nobody been informed us about the change. Also when I booking the room with breakfast and dinner, no one notified me, that dinner will be served only till 18h a clock. It looks like management often rents dining hall , no regards ti paying hotel guests. Charging guests for dinner, that they can get from 16h to 18h is redicules. The staff had - to question where can we get dinner - reacted very rude. Also from 19h to 21h we could not get to our room, because the only corridor was converted into a dining room for some sports club. The staff never left enough room to walk around the eating guests. Water in the pools, especially the temperature in the premises of the pools wos uncomfotrably low.My wife has got stuck in a broken lift. The alarm in the elevator did not work. I found my wife yelling for help after some time. The phone in the room did not work, so I could not call reception. So I grabbed the sleeping 3 years and 3 months old children, and walked to the front desk. Night concierge - a student - was the only nice and useful person that I encountered on our stay at the hotel. I would like to thank him for quick help and kindness. It is obvious, that the hotel is not maintained for a long time and that the staff is poorly managed.Worse hotel experience in my life.;Aquapark Zusterna Hotel;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeAquaparkZusternaHotel;Istrska cesta 67, Koper 6000, Slovenia;45.5457202;13.7100541

Our room was overlooking the sea, sunsets were beautiful to watch. Breakfast was good, dinner was OK. It is a great starting place to travel around slovenian coast, there are local buses that cost 2,5 eur per person and it takes around 40 minutes to get to Portoroz or Piran. Trieste, Italy is also close, 3 eur ticket, 45 mins bus drive. There is a promenade by the sea from the hotel to the old city takes about 15-20 minutes to get there. So all in all fun place for a vacation with kids.;Aquapark Zusterna Hotel;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeAquaparkZusternaHotel;Istrska cesta 67, Koper 6000, Slovenia;45.5457202;13.7100541
Decent accommodation for decent price;3;2.04.2015;With a potential to be the best hotel in Koper...it is a bit disappointing that the lack of investments in old infrastructure made this place average at best or bellow par if you are going to be really picky. Believe me when I say that I know this place very well. I almost lived in this hotel for a year (Monday to Friday every week). At this time I am a frequent guest (at least two nights every two weeks). I thing I was staying in every room that they have. :)Although hotel has *** star rating not all the rooms deserve that rating (quality of the rooms are not even remotely the same). They basically have three wings. Eastern one (the oldest one with worst rooms) has two floors and the rooms are the oldest, smallest and least comfortable. I avoid this wing (so should you). Frequent guests of this part of the hotels are organised groups (usually children or teenagers who are coming to Koper as a part of prearranged sport events or training...cycling clubs/swimming clubs/football teams...). There is a lot of noise there and you will not get much sleep staying there. Western wing is the highest part of the hotel (5 floors) and is located above the pool and aquapark. If you are here for a longer time (week or so) and if you are visiting this place because of the aquapark this is the best place to stay. Rooms are a bit updated (in comparison with those in eastern wing) and most definitely bigger so you will have much more comfort in this part of the hotel. The second benefit is that you are located just above aquapark so you would not have a long commute from your room to the pools (especially important if you are staying here during winter). Still you can find some teenage or children crews/teams accommodated here during year...so if you are seeking for a tranquility and peace it might not be the best place for you to stay. And finally there is the most eastern part of the hotel looking at hotel dining room. This is by far the best part of the hotel. Rooms there are fully updated with the most modern amenities. Rooms are modern and spacious, bathrooms are the finest you can find in this institution. There are no children/teenage groups in this part of hotel so level of noise is pretty low there and you can have your peace. Dining hall is really near also and the only disadvantage is that tis part is the farthest from the aquapark. Rooms in this wing are starting with number 6 (601, 602...) but they are actually on the ground level (and not on the 6th floor as one could expect). If you want to book this room go to any big booking online service and search for rooms in Zusterna, Koper declared as Superior room with flat TV (you should get this modernized ones this way and the price should be 70 to 85 EUR for single stay).You can have free WiFi in hotel lobby and in some rooms (which are close to the hotel lobby or hotel dining hall).Aquapark is worth visiting (especially because of the fact that it is free for hotel guests). It is not the biggest water park you have seen but it as basically all you need. Outside part of the aquapark has three pools (one for the children and one with the waves) and inside part of the aquapark has four pools (one big with heated sea water, and three smaller with regular water all heated, there are four whirlpools inside also). Aquapark is clean and well maintained. Main disadvantage is that if you are coming here during summer season especially during weekends or national holidays chances are it is going to be crowded so you will not enjoy as much you could if there would be less people fighting for their space in one of the pools.Hotel has a SPA area...actually two SPA areas. One (smaller) is located in the most eastern part of the hotel and offers Thai massages to the guests. Other (bigger) is located next to aquapark and offers four saunas (Finnish, Turkish, infrared and relax) one whirlpool and one shallow pool with water massage. All the amenities in SPA areas are not included in room/stay fee and you will pay extra for them. In my opinion part with saunas is well worth visiting. It is not the best I have seen but for 14 EUR per person it offers a lot and is well worth the money (especially taking in consideration that there are no time limit for hotel guests).Hotel has parking garage which is free for hotel guests which is a benefit since two other biggest hotels in Koper do not have parking space for your car. On the other hand those other two hotels are centrally located and hotel Zusterna is around 2 km from city center (15 to 20 minutes walking distance).Best meal of the day is breakfast so in my opinion you could go for bed+breakfast and have your lunch or dinner or both somewhere else. Lunch and dinners are blunt and of low quality (buffet type with old fashioned and all but decent dining experience). You have a lot of places in Koper where you can eat much better for the same amount of money.Personnel is frequently changed here and this fact is what brings level of customer experience bit down (because you constantly have people learning here and especially during peak seasons/parts of the year this can drive you a bit crazy). Cleaning service is the worst part of personnel team. The quality of their work is inconsistent, they are intrusive and usually do not respect guests privacy.You have two good restaurants in close proximity (one is pizza/pasta place and the other is a place which offers a local food in which grilled meat prevails) and I can highly recommend both of them.To conclude...if you (for some reason which is still not understandable to me) choose Koper as the place of your summer or any kind of vacation it would be a fair guess to say that this is the best place you can stay here especially if you are with children and aiming to spent most of your time in aquapark. Just make sure that you are getting updated rooms and organize yourself lunch/dinner somewhere else.;Aquapark Zusterna Hotel;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeAquaparkZusternaHotel;Istrska cesta 67, Koper 6000, Slovenia;45.5457202;13.7100541

You get what you pay for;3;8.04.2013;Before we booked this hotel I was looking on their official web site some pictures and information.There is clearly explained: the size of all types of rooms (in square meters) and equipment of each room. When we got there we got exactly what we paid for.We booked a room with balcony: it was medium size. The room was cleaned daily, the towels were changed every day. We didn't have wifi in the rooms ( we knew that before the arrival from the description of the rooms ).The food was good, but the choice was poor. The hotel staff was polite and helpful.The pools were clean, with warm water and our 4 year old san had a great fun.City beach is opposite the hotel . One part is made of concrete and the other , smaller part is rocky , and it was crowded during the day.Koper is a beautiful city. Peacful, quiet and with impressive architecture.The overall impression : it’s a average three-star hotel.;Aquapark Zusterna Hotel;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeAquaparkZusternaHotel;Istrska cesta 67, Koper 6000, Slovenia;45.5457202;13.7100541
Once great, going down fast..;4;26.01.2013;Great location and good facilities. The rooms (bungalows) were as expected, but very quiet and peaceful. The restaurant was very good, and with an international flair. I must say the whole feel of the place has altered greatly in the last 25 years. Once a family and general oriented place of paradise proportions, now merely a place for stupid kids having a rampage.;Aquapark Zusterna Hotel;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeAquaparkZusternaHotel;Istrska cesta 67, Koper 6000, Slovenia;45.5457202;13.7100541
only bad hostel;1;27.10.2012;It is obviously they rent rooms for youth on school excursions etc. Therefore hotel is broken also rooms and corridor. Bathroom is very old. Food is disaster no taste and a lot of grease, choice is pour. Even breakfast is bad. Nearby is very loud disco and and loud main road.

spa 3 days;3;1.05.2012;I was in this hotel during the summer and in winter,as if I visited two different hotels. Summer is still much better to come here for a visit. In winter, my main problem was that it was still cold in the room and the pool, so when you come out of the water known to be cold, it must be worn bathrobe. During the summer more pleasant outdoor pools are open that are clean and spacious. Although the street noise is not a great blouse. Food is self service and not bad for three days but not bored. I used the action for 3 days and booked through their website, pay at the hotel reception when leave. On the ground floor there is garage for hotel guests and is free, with ramp to get the cards at the reception. Hotel is old, it is seen that the renovated, but the concept I think they did maximum what could be done to improve it. I was satisfied with the hygiene, towels are changed, we get hygiene products.It is close to Italy, 15 minutes by car to Trieste, shooping is possible in a large shopping center in Koper. See is not very nice, is close to major cargo port, the beach is mostly concrete and stone. Better to go to Portorož swimming and fun. In the hotel there, and casino. Indoor swimming pool has a salt water.Rooms are medium in size, I was placed above the restaurant and the rooms are nicer than in the annex above the pool.;Aquapark Zusterna Hotel;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeAquaparkZusternaHotel;Istrska cesta 67, Koper 6000, Slovenia;45.5457202;13.7100541

Most of the staff speaks english and they are wery helpfull. We stay in the appartments and they are fresch and wellequippped. The hotel is a perfect startinngpoint if you to get acces to all the nice coastaltowns aswell as the capital ljubljana. Within one hour if driving you reach many interestibg sites such as the postojna caves, lipitza horsefarm ljubljana or even pula in croatia wich has an exact copy of the colliseum in rome alltjoug smaller.

Close your eyes and stay;2;23.02.2012;Far worse than expected. The hospitality staff is great, but the rooms were disappointing, the food is also scarce, and even swimming pools are not God knows better, this place just for people looking for overnight or what school excursions.

Never again!;1;18.06.2011;My father was eaten by bugs from a dog. The whole was a red papules from head to toe. The manager of the hotel took anything though neatly written complaint, to reimburse medical damage. My dad had to drive back to Macedonia 1200km in one breath to quickly call the doctor in Macedonia thus at risk our whole family.Do not try to respond to our requests to us orally and in writing we were not polite not like Slovenia and the European Union.

Nice place for family leisure;4;29.07.2010;Nice and clean hotel, especially WC in the inner and outer part of swimming pool. Food is excellent and fresh, I mostly like salads. There is game-room for children, little cars (my 3-year old child adoreslittle cars!). Swimming pools are warm and perfectly clean, my child liked all of it, but my husband and I liked the most the biggest pool with see water. I also liked underwater massage in big pools and jacuzzi. For completely relaxation you have spa center. If you travel by car, take a bicycle too, because Slovenian cost has the most beautiful bicycle road from Koper to Piran (they reconstructed old train road).I recommend one-day trip by catamaran to Venice from Izola (you have to check-in at travel agency KOMPAS in Pristaniska street in Koper) which costs 70 euros per person. City of Piran is great, you can go by air-conditioned bus (Koper-Piran line) for 3 euros, bus station is in front of Zusterna hotel. One must see Postojna Cave, too.We'll come to Slovenia next summer again, maybe to this hotel again.;Aquapark Zusterna Hotel;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeAquaparkZusternaHotel;Istrska cesta 67, Koper 6000, Slovenia;45.5457202;13.7100541

A great start to our trip with teenagers;5;20.11.2006;"Very easy to book directly. After Trieste got lost a bit found Koper wasn't sign-posted too well by the Italians, PLEASE NOTE signs will say Slovenia for a time then look out for \Capodistra\"" which is the old name for the town which used to be on a island. Hotel is part of a chain of 3 and 4* hotels, with an emphasis on relaxation and wellness. Has a beauty parlour. We did H/B. It was simply brilliant value! We did three days before going elsewhere. The hotel is on the coast road out of Koper. The swiming pool complex is a kind of mini center-parks style place, indoor and outddoor. We had a really funny water aerobics lady and the kids \""animation team\"" didn't disappoint and got their fancy dress on. we had a disco DJ for an hour one afternoon. The pool water outdoors was a little cold, indoors was warm and salty,and is actually on the first floor above reception, with an all around glass balcony. Our room was overlooking the sea and pool. The weather was perfect and it was great watching the really big ships come by into Koper Port. Didn't seem to have many English staying there, and more geared towards the Italians who visit over the border here regularly for the cheap cigs and booze. Everything was cheap this summer there, who knows what the euro will do to this wonderful country and it's people? At night, there is an avarage Pizzeria outside ( separete business, but part of the building) cheap large pizza for an evening snack L5-er. The best place for snack ANY time of night was the mini mart with hot and cold deli to the right as you leave reception. So cheap! Hot dogs for about 60p, can of Coke 20p, 3 litre bottle about 75p. They had crisps and all you need. There's a mini bar fridge in the room. It is not worth taking your drinks from it, just use it as a fridge. Sheets, beds, pillow, towels all very clean and staff helpful and friendly. Highly recommended. Great for families with children of all ages.Koper, although not one the most quaint of all the coastal towns has a fab outdoor market, some very interesting alternative herbal chemists, nice harbour, and very reasonably priced clothes and shoes and cafes. The Slovenians here love their rollerblades and bikes and seem to lead a very healthy lifestyle. This is a perfect base for Portoroz, not as glam and on the main coastal road out, but do both!""";Aquapark Zusterna Hotel;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeAquaparkZusternaHotel;Istrska cesta 67, Koper 6000, Slovenia;45.5457202;13.7100541

Rarely So Clueless a Reception;2;20.09.2016;"The stay wasn't a disaster, but this really is not a professionally run hote. It is integrated with what seems a popular restaurant and the restaurant seems to be the main business.I was going to be arriving between 9-10pm so as a precaution I thought I'd let them know by phone ahead of time. They couldn't find my reservation. Eventually they did and assured me someone would be at the desk. Arriving about 9.45pm I walked in to find no one at the desk. Upon ringing the bell, someone came out from the adjacent restaurant. They had their reservations on an old ledger, handwritten. The guy again couldn't find the reservation. He then called another guy from the restaurant who seemed to have more of a clue. It became clear why they couldn't find my reservation both in person and over the phone- my name had been scribbled at the top of the page in a tight space and was barely legible. They then told me where to go to my room, said the door was open and the key inside- the room was in an adjacent building. It was not open it was locked! I knocked on the door next to mine, where there was a phone number, thus indicating the guy in that room was associated with the hotel. He spoke no english but in sign language told me to go down and get the key. Evidently he didn't have it. I went back down to the adjacent building, again found no one in reception, again rang the bell. This time no one came from the restaurant so I went into the restaurant. The guy insisted the key was in the room and the guy I spoke to was \crazy'...his word!. We went up together to find the room locked. I was then left standing there, now at 10.15pm while he went off to find the key. Eventually I got into the room. On checkout when I went to pay, the lady at the desk, probably the 'working hours' receptionist wanted to charge me 7% more...it's only when I showed her my booking confirmation that she said 'ah yes you have the old rate' and charged me the appropriate amount. Like I said not a disaster, but I've rarely had any place where reception didn't have the key!!""";Hotel Bio;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelBio;Vanganelska cesta 2, Koper 6000, Slovenia;45.532111;13.7364826

I was very surprised about the room, it was very modern and in one word great. But bathroom was kind of need of repair.

Nice hotel near transportation to neighboring towns;3;24.07.2015;My husband and I stayed at this hotel for five nights. Its location is good if you want to take day-trips by bus or car to neighboring towns (Piran, Isola, Trieste) which we did. The bus is a five minute walk away. There is also a mall close by. The walk to the center of Koper is about 25 minutes.The hotel restaurant has great, well-priced food and friendly staff and I recommend eating here. We ate there twice during our stay. The hotel internet was unreliable and seemed to work only off-peak hours and not in the mornings and evenings where most people where in the hotel. The room was clean upon arrival but the daily upkeep was so-so. Basically they only made the bed and took the towels we wanted replaced, but didn't always replace with clean ones. We managed fine and we probably wouldn't have noticed if we would have stayed there for only a couple of days.;Hotel Bio;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelBio;Vanganelska cesta 2, Koper 6000, Slovenia;45.532111;13.7364826

Sometimes you look across a busy road to a port or beach. The sea view from the upper floors of the hotel Piran (we were on the third) is quite different. Between you and the water's edge is only a foot way. You really can throw a stone from your balcony into the sea.OK so far so good but what other features does this hotel possess? Well as well as the sea it has the perfect location for the rest of Piran: a few steps from the harbour and main square. The breakfast is excellent and not to be missed.But a good hotel needs good staff and this hotel has them aplenty. I should particularly thank the receptionist who solved our problem of getting to Trieste. We prefer to travel by train and bus and although I normally plan each stage meticulously I had merely noted that there were two buses daily to Trieste. But it was Sunday! That meant just one bus from Korea at 7am necessitating a 6 am departure from Piran. The receptionist found us a taxi at €60 which would take us to the door of our hotel in Trieste at a time of our choosing - a little more expensive than two fares to Koper, two fares to Trieste and a taxi in Trieste to our hotel but not much. It made our journey so much easier.I should also mention that the room was spacious and well equipped but that almost goes without saying for a hotel with standards as high as Hotel Piran.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
very disappointing;2;6.05.2017;staff was friendly and helpful. Room was tiny. Bed was flush against wall on one side and no bedstands. Seaview was great but the excellent balcony had no chairs and no tables. It was, however, well appointed with one ashtray. We asked the desk for balcony chairs and a table. it never arrived.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Great location;4;27.04.2017;This hotel is right on the waterfront in this quaint little beach resort. It is also close to the big plaza in the town center. Our corner room was quite nice with windows on two directions.It was clean and modern and so was the washroom.Not inexpensive either even in mid-April.Breakfast was good.The staff was friendly.Note that parking is a problem in Piran. You must park your car in a pay parking outside the village , though the hotel will assist you with a shuttle.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Great location, mediocre rooms.;3;15.04.2017;Hotel Piran has a fabulous waterfront location and the sea view from our balcony was superb - that said, the rooms are definitely not 4 star rooms. We had a sea view double which was quite small (to be expected in a historic building) but was also quite outdated and tired. You could not walk out on your balcony without being in full view of the guests on either side of you. We could not get the AC to work and so we slept with the sliding door to the balcony open a bit and I could clearly hear a neighbor on one side snoring loudly and a couple nearby clearly enjoying themselves. The saving grace for this hotel was the fabulous staff who went above and beyond to assist with all of our questions and requests and the great bar taking advantage of the proximity to the sea.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Good Hotel with Great View and Kind Staff;5;26.01.2017;Though I didn't stay at the property but I was there for the visit and it was really good. Its a mid sized property on the coast. The roof top restaurant 99 steps is the best place if you would want to enjoy the panaromic views of Piran, Umag, Croatia as it is just adjacent to the property and on a clear day you can even have a glimpse of Trieste, Italy which lies to the right.The Sales manager Dagmar was really kind enough as she took us to the every nook and corner of the property. The rooms were big and had an amazing view overlooking the Adriatic Sea. I would really want to thank her for all the efforts she had put in.On my next visit I am definitely staying at this property and I would recommend this property to each and everyone.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Expensive Silvester in Piran;2;25.01.2017;We decided spontanuous to have our Silvester - Party in Piran and found the only free room in the hotel Piran. It was a large room or better an apartment with four beds. Of course we were only two persons. Unfortunately the room had also two big disadvantages. First there were some cushions in the wardrobe which had a realy bad smell so we had to open all windows every time we entered the room. Second at the outside of the hotel there are some lightings which shine all night on the balkony and from there directly into the bedroom. So although the room had a really good view it was not very clean and it was too lightish for sleeping. For the party we booked also the special Silvester-dinner for € 100 per person without drinks and for that price it was very disappointing. The five courses came too fast and we had the impression that the staff wanted us to finish early so they could join their own party. The meals were ok but for that price too common. Although we had some good days outside the hotel this was an extremely expensive trip (we paid €250 for two people per night). So we cannot recommend the hotel but the city of Piran is really nice and worth visiting.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Best Location in the Town;4;31.12.2016;With direct access to the promenade and located backing on to the central square the location couldn't be better.

Exceptional location in a lovely city with friendly staff;4;17.12.2016;The location on the sea could not be better. The hotel give you the ability to walk around the city and enjoy what Piran has to offer. The room was a good size. There was a small desk that gave plenty of space for my computer and for charging devices. The bathroom was not very large but it was still updated and nice enough. The bed was comfortable and the overall feel of the warm was contemporary but still comfortable. Our room we had a very nice balcony that gave us a lovely view of the sea. The service was excellent and friendly. Reception was very helpful and had nice recommendation for seeing Piran. The breakfast was very good with several options and very friendly service. The staff that we experienced all spoke excellent english and they were very easy for us to communicate with. Parking is just outside of the city center and there is a shuttle that will take you from the parking area to the hotel. We did drive into the hotel and drop off our luggage and check in prior to parking. We elected to walk as it is not that far but I can see that being an issue for some.It was an excellent place to stay to enjoy the area. Piran is a lovely city and the Piran Hotel was a very comfortable hotel to have a great night's rest.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Fantastic location but rooms not really 4 star.;4;13.11.2016;Fantastic location right in the centre of the town and overlooking the water with views across to Croatia. Whilst the hotel advertises itself as 4 star I would say that the quality of the rooms, furniture, bathroom etc are not really 4 star. If advertised and priced as a 3 star hotel I think that would be appropriate and the hotel would be excellent at that standard and price point. The ground floor lobby, bar and restaurant area are excellent and when the weather is good, the bar and terrace are an absolutely fantastic place to sit, enjoy a cold beer and watch the world go by. Finding the hotel is easy enough if you follow their directions. Arriving by car was fine and we drove right up to the main entrance and dropped off our bags. The car then needs to be driven to the main multi-story car-park on the edge of the old town. This can be done with the help of a hotel driver or on your own and getting back to the hotel either by frequent free shuttle or a pleasant 20 minute walk. The hotel's rate at the car park is much better than simply paying direct to the car park so make sure you arrange this with the hotel reception in advance or on arrival.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Our favourite place on the Slovenian coast;5;12.11.2016;We stayed in the hotel for our wedding day/night. The staff was very friendly and helpful.

a peaceful enjoyable place;4;23.10.2016;we know this hotel for many years, and it is actually a good address. however some facilities are changing because the main board want to upgrade the place/standards of the hotel. i do not know if they will succeed: advantages= nice employees, secure peaceful place, about 10-15 minutes walk far from Piran down town, hiking along the shore. good cookers . clean placedisadvantages: rooms not too much noise isolated, no more buffet, risks of long wait after ordering your meal at the restaurant, ideas of extra options still not very effective (extra beds for resting on the beach, but noisy environment in your back, (people walking, hotel radio with news,...) deciding not to propose anymore the all inclusive offers but services available separately , you do have to pay for the umbrella, the coins for shower....);Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Single room does not seem like a 4-star hotel;3;4.10.2016;I knew the single room would be very small and have a dorm-type bed, but the room was also quite dated as well.

I had hoped to use the spa but couldn't figure out the services provided. The people at reception told me to consult the information in my room but there wasn't any, and the front desk said I needed to check with the spa - but the spa was closed all of the times I checked.Otherwise, the view from the room is lovely, and the breakfast was quite good and in a great spot right on the water.

Not much choice in Piran, very disappointed! ;2;23.09.2016;My husband and I recently stayed here for four nights. Couldn't wait to leave. The location is great as it opens onto the seafront and the breakfast is also very good. It falls short after that. It started when we entered the room on a 30 degree day and the lobby was cooler than the room. Reception and the manager said that was the level of air conditioning throughout all the rooms. We didn't sleep as it was so hot. I think they were too cheap to give us more cooling. They gave is a fan. We had to call down for soap, towels and toilet paper, lazy cleaning staff. The bed was so hard we could barely walk in the morning. The restaurant staff and Teni at reception we extremely rude and detached. They just didn't care. Won't be going back here.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Big disappointment, feel cheated!;2;18.09.2016;The hotel advertise their rooftop bar area as well as spa, but turns out both are closed! Our first night was sunny and dry, we were looking forward to enjoy a cocktail and watch the sunset from the roof bar - it was closed with no reason!The next day it rained and I was looking forward to relax in the sauna, but apparently the spa won't open until November! This was not mentioned at the time of the booking!There is no way this hotel should be allowed to sell rooms with spa included when the spa is not open! Very disappointing experience as the hotel doesn't actually have anything else, no comfortable seating areas, no nice restaurant or bar areas..Wifi is very unreliable.

Scenic location;5;13.09.2016;This hotel is over 100 years old and has been recently renovated. Rooms differ in size depending on the bed type requested.

They need to put the restaurant staff on the same customer service course as the folk on reception!;4;10.09.2016;The great thing about this hotel is its location - right by the sea. What could be lovelier than returning to your hotel from a day out and throwing open your balcony window to see the sun going down over the sea? A sea view room is an essential here as apart from that magnificent view, the rooms are pleasant enough but a bit faded and average, although unlike some other reviewers we found the bed perfectly comfortable. The reception staff were charming and efficient. Marco didn't show the slightest irritation when we kept asking him questions about the rather complicated parking arrangements (more of this later) and when we informed reception about a minor problem with our room, the matter was dealt with promptly. If only the same could be said of the restaurant staff. We only ate there on our first evening, partly because of the arrogance of both our waiters and partly the cost. Breakfast was satisfactory but we had much better experiences at other, far less expensive venues. In particular, the cooked food was most uninviting, because it was cooked en masse and not to order. Once again, the restaurant staff were not that friendly or particularly helpful. My request for more cereal bowls to be put out was met with a grunt and we found it irritating to have to ask for cutlery as it did not seem to be replenished when a table had been used.Parking is at a garage out of town. We fully understand and appreciate the reasons for this. Apart from having to wait about an hour on the first night for the shuttle bus to guide us to the garage and bring us back with our luggage, the system worked quite well. However, to the uninitiated the system is quite complex and while Marco answered all our questions patiently, it would be much better if they provided all guests on arrival with a short written explanation.Would we stay there again? Yes - absolutely. Could the customer experience be better? Yes - absolutely. In this case location is everything but this should not be an excuse for being complacent about other aspects of provision and service.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Big Disappointment;3;3.09.2016;I was driving back to Italy from Croatia and was fortunate to obtain a last minute booking for a junior suite at Hotel Piran. Considering this was the tail end of the summer holiday season I hadn't really held out much hope of being able to find anything in the area.I had noticed the hotel some weeks previously while spending the day in Piran and thought I'd enjoy staying there when I returned. The hotel is located in an historic building and the front exterior is quite beautiful. The interior however is another story.It is yet another tragic example of this unfathomable mania sweeping Europe where you sterilize your historic building by removing anything that is beautiful, interesting or charming, furnish it from IKEA and then declare it to be chic and contemporary. I'm curious by what rating system Hotel Piran obtained four stars. Aren't there certain levels of standards that must be achieved and maintained?My junior suite consisted of two rooms in which neither air conditioner worked adequately.The sliding door to my balcony had had the lock removed which left no means to secure it and could be easily opened by somebody wishing to enter from the balcony - a serious threat to my personal safety!!The carpet in my room was little better than indoor/outdoor grade and was stained. The divider between the adjoining balcony left large gaps between the two areas which allowed a view from the other balcony directly into my room. The only way to prevent this from happening is to keep your curtains closed which is the last thing you want to do in an oceanfront room.When I reported the door lock situation to the front desk I was informed that yes, they had in fact been removed as guests had been locking themselves on the balcony. I suppose this was meant to be offered as a satisfactory explanation as no offer was made to change rooms. There are some serious liability issues here.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Perfect location! The rest have to be discussed separately...;3;25.08.2016;The most interesting and attractive aspect for this hotel is location. It stands directly at the seaside, just two-three meters away from the sea. Tables outside allow you to have breakfast with a perfect view and breath the fresh air. The only thing you have to worry about is the birds (rather big seagulls) hunting for your breakfast, that’s why restaurant staff always remind you “not to leave your food alone”…Hotel Piran is announced like a 4 star hotel but frankly speaking I would say it is more close to 3 stars, especially taking into consideration the room. Carpet on the floor is seriously dated and rather dusty, room is dark, furniture have had to be changed years ago, beds are extremely cheap, mattress are hard and thin. I would say that when you are in the lobby or in the breakfast room you could imagine yourself in 4 star hotel but when you enter your room – disappointments enters together with you. Price seems to be too high for the value and I am sure (I know it 100%) that for this price you could find better possibilities at the seaside in Italy. Cleaning service is poor, they clean you room somehow but not so accurately and thoroughly. Moreover, housekeeper ignores “do not disturb” sign hanging on the door handle and enters the room using her key. Not acceptable of course. Towels are good clean, white and thick enough. Breakfast is good, fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, good choice for cheese and ham, hot dishes – out of discussion. BUT! - you would have to pay for the coffee otherwise you have to drink some brown liquid which is far from the coffee. When you pay 1,3 EUR for espresso you receive really good and high quality drink but if you decide to drink what they offer you at the “coffee machine” – better to drink tea or juice, believe me. Wi-fi connection is good, no password is required but you need to login every time, you could not stay online without logging in after some 30-40 minutes or so – not really convenient if you are writing some long email or prepare presentation with necessary permanent access to the Internet. At the same time I must say that wi-fi signal is strong enough and it easily reaches sunbeds in front of the hotel. By the way, two sunbeds + sun umbrella cost 15 EUR/day for hotel guests, beach towels (very small and thin) are included. Take note that you need to reserve sunbeds in the evening of the previous day – this is important. Take it into consideration please otherwise there is a risk to be rejected as the area with sunbeds is really limited. Hotel staff is rather friendly and helpful even though I have to mention one minor point. Some time prior to our arrival I asked them to organize the birthday cake for my wife who has had her birthday during our stay at Hotel Piran and it was confirmed. On the day nothing happened, could you imagine how embarrassed was I?! I went to the reception and the guy there told me he can’t find anything in his records. Oh, please, no?!? It was a clear discussion and clear confirmation from te reception staff who wrote me that they would be “more than happy” to organize my wife’s birthday. Nevertheless Mario (thanks again!) was active enough to organize the piece of cake with the candle for my wife and saved the situation. BUT! - normally such situations should never happen.There is no parking at the hotel and you have to leave your car at the public parking above the city. Validating your ticket at the hotel reception you’ll pay 7.5 EUR/day for the parking. Hotel got the free shuttle to the parking (mini bus). Driver is really nice and friendly person! But this shuttle running time is quite limited so if you come back in the evening you’ll have either walk the way to the hotel down the hill or wait for the public free shuttle to the center of Piran (two minutes walking distance from the hotel). I am not sure that I would choose this hotel again ever but it’s location is really awesome.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Drinks to watch the sun set. Wonderful!!;5;21.08.2016;We came to Hotel Piran most days to have an Aperol Spritz and watch the sun set. A couple of days we even when for a sunset swim with the kids and then had a drink. Absolutely perfect!We didn't stay at the hotel but it looked like it was really lovely and if we were to come to Piran for a weekend visit we would definitely look to stay here!;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
A lovely hotel;4;20.08.2016;I visited this hotel with my family last week. On the whole the experience was good. The view out to the sea from reception was very impressive but there are a few minor niggles. Our room was 213 and was overlooking the road at the front of the hotel. The beds, I found to be pretty uncomfortable, very hard indeed. The air conditioning barely worked at all and was very old fashioned which meant the room was stuffy. The noise outside was not good at all, any double glazing they put in to minimise the noise definitely didn't work.Breakfast was very good with an excellent choice for all nationalities the only gripe was that not all the tables were laid with cutlery so after you'd chosen your breakfast you had to catch the eye of the waiter to ask him for cutlery, which was pretty annoying, surely it's much easier to re lay tables after people had vacated them? The girls on reception were really good, friendly and very helpful.The shuttle service between the hotel and the car park worked well but I did feel slightly miffed that we had to pay for parking, surely the hotel could easily incorporate this within its price or include it as it's not a cheap hotel to stay in. Overall the experience was good and if I needed to stay in the area again I would go back.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Fabulous stay in Piran;5;15.08.2016;Stayed at the Hotel Puran this week and it was perfect for us. Ideal location right on the water, beautiful and very spacious room, decorated very nicely and with a large marble bathroom and excellent shower. Plenty of hanging space too. Breakfast was included and we enjoyed it outside near the water. Sun lounges and umbrellas available on request. The staff were very attentive. We also tried out the rooftop bar for cocktails while watching the sun set. Fabulous! The town itself has lots of nice bars and restaurants and a few nice clothing shops and a very interesting ceramic shop called Atelje Duka right near the hotel (very creative ceramics). Would highly tecommend this hotel. Wish we could have stayed longer!!;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Great location, not so great room;3;15.08.2016;The location of the property is fantastic. It is in the heart of the town but at the same time at the ocean. Stepping out of the hotel you can jump into the Mediterranean Sea. Chairs and umbrellas can be rented for 5 Euro a piece. Restaurants are just steps away and the breakfast terrace is also good for afternoon cocktails. Check out the beautiful rooftop terrace.The staff was very friendly, they offer a shuttle service to the garage and the breakfast is good.The city view room we had was loud and the room itself is not what you would expect from a four star hotel. It might have all the amenities of a four star (towels, blow dryer, little shampoo bottles etc..), but overall it was more what I encounter in 2 star inns. The bed was horrible.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
What a seaside hotel should be (on the surface) ;3;12.08.2016;This hotel could have been the perfect compliment to our stay in Piran. It's as close as you can get to the water, in fact I doubt I will ever see another hotel with the front desk in such proximity. It wows you the moment you walk in the front door.Parking is a hassle but the hotel has a system of escorting you to a parking lot and shuttling you back. The staff work very very hard and are generally excelllent.Food is alright, though it won't leave a lasting impression.The room we had was really lovely with a large balcony overlooking the seafront, most of the rooms are set up this way I think. No issues at all here. Comfortable, clean and spacious.The reason I'm not giving this place full marks is because I feel cheated by the hotel. We forfeited the first night due to a flight cancellation and I had called to inform them that we were going to arrive a day late in the morning. They said that they would still charge me the first night but that my room would be available when I arrived the morning after. Not true. We arrived precisely at the time I told them but had to wait for 2 hours for a room since they had sold it to another guest. The least they could have done was offer us the breakfast which was included but they would only offer a drink while we waited.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Best choice in Piran;4;11.08.2016;This hotel is right on the seafront and is the most luxurious hotel in Piran. Rooms are still quite basic but very clean with wonderful sea views. The sun loungers run by the hotel are very useful and everything is on the doorstep. The rooftop bar has incredible views over the bay, a must at sunset. Our only niggle was that our air con didn't work properly which lead to some hot nights. I would stay here again if I returned to Piran.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Great hotel right on the sea front;5;7.08.2016;We spent three nights at this lovely hotel and had the third floor suite (302) with direct sea views. The suite was spacious with a double bed in one section and a sitting area/extra bed(s) adjacent with an ample balcony which had two loungers on it. From the moment we arrived, the staff were extremely attentive and informative, recommending good local restaurants and explaining how to reserve a sun lounger/parasol outside the hotel the following day. This system worked really well and there was never a need to 'towel book' or worry about availability. The booking had been arranged in January through the hotel's website and everything was exactly as we'd asked which meant a great start to our Slovenia holiday.As others have mentioned (i) there is a fantastic view from the roof top bar and it's worth paying the price for a drink up there (I think that tables can also be reserved - ask reception) (ii) on Friday and Saturday nights, there was some late night noise from a distant nightclub but this is hardly the hotel's fault and could be minimised by closing the balcony doors and putting on the air con. Sleeping with the balcony doors open and listening to the waves breaking on our final night was really refreshing!The breakfast is excellent and again as others have said, it's possible to sit outside facing the sea or inside in the hotel itself. An excellent location in a fantastic town with wonderful staff.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Great Holiday;5;6.08.2016;Fantastic location on the sea front. We received a warm welcome on arrival. The room was comfortable and clean. Views from the roof top terrace were spectacular. Breakfasts were delicious as was the food in general, while the staff were friendly, helpful and professional. Piran itself was a vibrant, charming location. All in all a thoroughly enjoyable holiday.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Lovely Hotel;4;5.08.2016;The best place to stay in Piran. The hotel is beautifully decorated with quirky little finishing touches, especially the 'fact of the day' (who knew that Johnny Depp collects Barbie dolls, or that a rat can last longer without water than a camel?). The hotel itself is situated along the sea front with loungers and umbrellas available for rent to hotel guests. Although there is no beach, the sea is easily accessed by steps from the concrete platform on which the loungers are situated.Our room was tastefully furnished and had a small balcony overlooking the sea. Breakfasts were very good and it was lovely being able to eat breakfast outside on the terrace.One small flaw was the air-con, it didn't seen to be very effective. Perhaps we didn't use it properly, or perhaps being Irish we're not used to such heat!! However, all in all this is a great hotel and worth staying in if visiting Piran.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Very nice hotel;4;26.07.2016;Very nice hotel on the seaside with a beach (actually a concrete deck), you can rent chairs and umbrella (5eur each). The hotel has amazing breakfast buffet and a rooftop terrace (open just in the evening) with a beautiful view, there is also a bar, but drinks are not really good and expensive. Rooms are quite big and cozy also with a minibar fridge. The only one really annoying thing is the loud aircondition in the room, but if you open the window it will automaticly stop and let you sleep :).

Relaxing stay in a room with a sea view;5;23.07.2016;From my first email to the hotel until the end of our stay the hotel staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. They suggested walks to us, restaurants in the town and how to economically and directly get to Ljubljana airport for our flight. The breakfast had the usual things for a European breakfast (cereals, bread, meat, cheese and cooked food) and the staff kindly prepare us a packed brunch because we had to leave for our flight before the breakfast started at 7pm. We specifically booked a room with a sea view and it was lovely to be able to sit on our balcony at any time of day watching the world go by or enjoying the music from a swing band playing on the harbour (and even a very impressive thunder storm). Our room had one of the smaller balconies - but we did manage to fit two chairs on it (just). The hotel does not have a pool but has a jetty so you can swim in the sea and then relax enjoying drinks from the hotel cafe. Again the bar staff were very friendly (the chocolate mousse cake and cocktails in particular were great). We just wished we could have stayed longer!;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

The hotel in Piran;5;18.07.2016;If you decide to go to Piran - and I highly recommend you do, it's beautiful! - do choose Hotel Piran! My partner and I simply loved to stay there. First of all, the location of the hotel right on the beach and right around the corner from the main square (Tartini Square) cannot be beat. We loved having breakfast on the seafront terrace. The buffet-style breakfast was excellent as well. I was especially happy with the selection of different fresh fruits. As I'm not a friend of sandy beaches, I was very happy with the concrete docks next to the hotel. The water here is incredibly clear and turquoise in color, and it's easy to either step or jump into the water. A hint, though: if you want to make sure you get to lay out on the docks, you'd better get your sun bed and umbrella right after breakfast, before they're all gone for the day (there's a limited number of sun beds and umbrellas available - I'm not sure if you can do it the day before). This is a public beach, though, so there will be other people bathing there as well. Our hotel room had no frills but it was comfortable and large enough for the two of us. Our room faced the city, and there was some noise from the street in the night - I was happy I had a pair of ear plugs with me.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

The staff are all very friendly and hard-working.I am so thankful that I found this place and that we stayed here.

Breakfast with a view;4;18.07.2016;"There is a lot to tell about this hotel, and I will :)First of all the location, traffic is almost impossible in Piran, so you can get with your car up till the hotel, and stay 15 minutes, and then you have to go back out of Piran through the narrow \roads\"" full of scooters, pedastrians, taxis,... The hotel does offer a free shuttle service from the garage to the hotel. You pay for that garage 7.5 Euro a day, and you can enter or leave as many times as you want. You just have to ask a special exit ticket at the reception. When at the garage, you give the hotel a call and they will come to pick you up. This is very convenient.We took a room with a terras and sea view. The room itself was very basic, with a very basic, small bathroom. Not even suitable for two persons at the same time.Some things in the bathroom were broken, and some pipes were corroded.Also the terras was very small, just enough for a very small table and 2 chairs. But the view was spectacular.The room was also very small, with almost no storage room for luggage. So we had to keep almost everything in the travel bags.The room has an OK airco and a little fridge. There was also a little vault, but that one was also broken.There is Wifi available all around the hotel, but it is terribly slow and unstable. It disconnects all the time.The breakfast is nice, there is a lot of choice, also the coffee is more than decent.Some day to day variation of the breakfast would be nice plus.What makes the breakfast totally top notch is the fact that you can eat outside, near to the sea. If you choose the tables the closest to the sea, and if you're lucky, the sea will splash on your plate :) Attention to the seagulls though. They tend to steal food from your plate if you leave your table.The hotel also has a bar on the rooftop. It opens in the evening and provides a great view on the bay and its surroundings.The beds are comfortable, but if the sea is rough the noise will keep you away, same for loud tourists passing by.The personnel is very friendly and helpful. They serve you with a smile, and that is just great.This is a nice hotel, with a lot of attention to funny details, but I won't tell them here, you'll have to keep your eyes open and discover it yourselves :)""";Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
A great hotel in an amazing city;5;17.07.2016;We stayed at the hotel for two short nights - we really wish we could have extended and stayed longer. Everything was great: the staff was extremely helpful, warm, and hospitable. The rooms were great - except that the air conditioning system is found lacking in the extreme heat - it fell to a whisper of cool air. Breakfast and dinner were well prepared (dinner was a bit pricey). The location was right on the water. Don't expect a beach because it is a concrete pier. The bar at the top of the hotel offered amazing views while enjoying a cool beverage. For the beach - make sure to reserve chairs early as they are in high demand.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

There is a roof terrace open for drinks and sunset-watching in the evenings; spectacular view and worth a visit but watch out for the fierce mark-up on the drinks.

Adriatic gem!;4;6.07.2016;Hotel Piran has the prime position in the town, right on the sea-front and two minutes from the main square and harbour. It is an up-market establishment, and we found the staff mostly very friendly and helpful. The breakfasts were superb, with a huge range of cereals, fruits, breads, meats, cheese, salads, etc. On fine days breakfast could be taken on the seafront. Food and drink were available all day, but we didn’t dine there although the menu looked appealing. Our bedroom was large enough but with very little storage space. It boasted a seaview “balcony” which was so small that only one person at a time could fit on it. An alternative might have been the delightful roof terrace, but this was available only after 6.30 in the evening - despite our being told we could use it when we wished. In common with all Slovenian hotels there were no tea-making facilities in the room.Piran itself is a fascinating old town, with a strong Italian flavour. No visitors' cars are allowed within its boundaries, except for deliveries and to drop visitors and their luggage. Vehicles were garaged a few minutes away, accessible by a free shuttle.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Returned happily to this lovely place;4;3.07.2016;Piran never fails to exert a kind of magic. It is so pretty, people so welcoming. The hotel itself has some of the best trained staff, endlessly patient, smiling and they all-of course! have good English ( and Italian and German). We were all asked about the Brexit vote and hurriedly told them of our embarrassment. We were all invited olive there. And it would be lovely but only for about 1/4 of the year!Weather was lovely.up to 30C every day. Stunning sunsets.Hotel rooms are not luxurious but then the daily rate for a single room isn't exceptionally high either. Breakfast is buffet type and has everything you could wish for. Rooms could do with additional rubbish bins, bed side lights and one room had no phone and just had wires protruding. These are minor quibbles.Food at lunch time is fine- and the menu changed on the 1st July-when we think school holidays started so this is probably the date to avoid! There is no beach as such outside the hotel, one goes down into the sea via steps which were cleaner of algae i think but which can be slippery. Shoes to protect one from slipping and the rocky sea floor can be bought. The sea is refreshing. huge waves are created when ships pass which is fun. there are beaches a short walk away. But they are not sandy. The Piran town square is a great place to people watch- an elderly man showing us his ability to roller skate, trumped by a 5yr old doing the same! A drink at Hotel Tartini before supper is a precursor to an enjoyable evening. Eat fish on a boat in the harbour-caught that day with rough local white wine. Great in situ but probably not as delicious here!;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Perfect;5;28.06.2016;Have been to Piran a few times and wanted to stay here. I wasn't disappointed. The hotel is really luxury feeling and for Piran, it seems spacious.The reception staff are actively friendly and helpful - we enjoyed talking to them and they helped us with a few things.The room had a great balcony view. The bathroom was well equipped. The A/C works without being noisy. The beds have single duvets on the double (which we preferred).Wifi works just fine.If you are driving, they will arrange transfer from the out of town car park for free, and also discount the parking charge. This makes a difference when you have some lugagge on a hot day!The breakfast was just excellent, so much choice to cater for all tastes, and good quality. I loved the wholemeal croissants. The bar out front is a good spot and the cocktail menu is good (Their French 75 is really nice)One reason to stay was we thought we got access to the concrete beach in front of the hotel included - a sun lounger was €5/day with a parasol €15, so its a fair expense to add in that's worth considering. It was mega convenient though!Look forward to a longer stay next time.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Waterfront Location;4;28.06.2016;"The Hotel Piran overlooks Piran's seaside promenade and the Adriatic; Croatia is in the distance. The staff were very efficient and helpful. Our room was good sized and had all the amenities plus it had a small balcony. There is a convenient restaurant on-site. This is all good but there are some things to be aware of. Since we were on the waterfront and the promenade (from which there is swimming), there is the attendant seaside noise during the day (but we didn't find any issue at night). Also, we were on the second floor which was above the terrace that abuts the restaurant. This is, understandably, a place to sit and have a drink. And smoke. We did experience some effect (not great, but a little) from the smokers during the day and early evening. It may be that a room higher up wouldn't have the same experience.";Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Bit disappointed! ;4;9.06.2016;We chose this hotel for its location and it lived up to that. But when I saw trip advisor winner posters in reception I expected something outstanding. The reception staff were good but today when we wanted to leave we were told the shuttle bus not available till 1 so use free bus and get car, but as we were leaving saw other guests getting in free hotel shuttle car! The room was nice but no window to safely open, you had to have Balcony doors open all night as no air con either. Did not like that! Also beds very hard! And coffee for breakfast was poor! Am being nit picky but at 153€ a night and the trip advisor winner! There should not be niggles like these.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Can we go back now please? :);5;6.06.2016;"Our weekend in Piran was simply amazing. The location is great...right by the sea! We (two couples) had separate sea view rooms. Both were great. Our room on the 2nd floor was \smaller\"" than the sea view room the other couple had on the 4th floor, but no complaints at all! Our room was very nice, clean and the size was good enough for two people. Plus, we spent most of our days out and about anyways!Our booking included free breakfast and it was great! Buffet style and different selections (meats, cheeses, eggs, fruits, cereals, breads, coffee, etc.) The staff at the hotel restaurant was very friendly. We were always greeted with a smile and the service was great and fast! They really know how to show hospitality towards guests. Piran is not very big, so walking around is not a problem. Our booking included 1 hour free to use the Vespa the hotel provided. It was so much fun! I believe it is around 30Euros to rent it for half the day...and if we had more time we would have totally done that!We have no complaints about this place. We just simply had an amazing stay and a great time at this hotel and in Piran in general.We will DEFINITELY be back again and will choose Hotel Piran hands down :)""";Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Balcony rooms over the sea;5;5.06.2016;This Hotel location is ideal to walk to everything in Piran. Second or third floor with a balcony over the sea is ideal, Check to make sure that the a/c is working in your room before committing. They don't have anyone on site to fix it. The rooms are a good size and recently modernized. The staff in the Hotel and the restaurant were all friendly and helpful.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Great spot overlooking the sea;4;5.06.2016;"This hotel is well located right on the water in Piran, Slovenia's version of a gorgeous Italian Riviera town. We had booked one of the \attic\"" rooms, which did make us feel like we were staying in a garret, with a sloping ceiling and portholes (instead of windows) right near the floor. There was also a skylight overhead, which was great for light but not so great in a rainstorm -- it was quite noisy when the rain pelted it! I'd have had a hard time sleeping through that, but fortunately the weather calmed down before I had to go to bed.The room was a decent size and had a couch, desk and chair, as well as a TV and free wifi. (One annoyance about the wifi: you had to keep logging in over and over, even if you'd only put your phone down for a few minutes. As soon as you were inactive, you had to start over again, and once it even conked out in the middle of an active session.) It's hard to beat the hotel's location, within easy walking distance of the main square and numerous waterfront restaurants. (Not that Piran is large -- just about everything is within walking distance.) There's no parking within the central area of town, but the hotel offers a free shuttle to the parking lot if you're not up for walking with your luggage. The front desk staff was generally friendly and helpful.The included breakfast had lots of hot and cold options, most of it pretty good. (I did have one glass of orange juice that tasted strangely flavorless, as though overly diluted?) Specialty coffees were additional, but I'm not a coffee drinker so that didn't bother me.Overall I'd happily stay here again, especially if I could dig up the extra funds for a full seaview room with balcony instead of staying in the garret. :)""";Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Wonderful oceanfront hotel. Like staying on the Italian Rivera... except cheaper!;5;3.06.2016;We stayed here in May, 2016 and had a wonderful stay. To be frank the hotel doesn't look like much from the outside (kind of drab) but the inside is first class. The staff is friendly and professional.

Great location in a beautiful part of the world ;4;3.06.2016;Firstly, Piran is an amazing place. Postcard picturesque- in low season when the sun is shining. Very quiet in June, although I understand the place is heaving mid summer. Whilst it is quiet, had no problem getting a lovely table overlooking the water for breakfast. Food is pleasant- usual array of buffet, although it's a shame you have to pay extra for a decent cup of coffee given the prices. Rooftop bar lovely as well.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
wonderful surprise;5;2.06.2016;We spent one evening in Piran and were lucky to get a room at Hotel Piran. It overlooks the sea and has a delightful sitting area to have drinks, dinner and breakfast. The room was very nice, even ours which did not face the sea. The staff were extremely coureous and helpful. You can not park at the hotel but they have a wonderful service where they will drive with you to the parking area and bring you back and then take you to your car when you are ready to depart. Great location to walk to the major sites in town. Highly recommend the hotel and this quite location.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
A Wonderful 1 night stay;5;2.06.2016;We visited Piran for 1 night staying at Hotel Piran. Very good internet communication especially with Andrej, the front office manager. We received much more than we asked for.We stayed in their Mini Suit facing the see, the harbor and part of the old city.Very nice and professional staff. The room was very large, Very clean, nice bathroom and a balcony.Breakfast was superb with a large verity to choose from.We rate this hotel as a 10++;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Toplocation in a very unique place;3;21.05.2016;First I have to say I was very happy to see that my hotelbooking in this authentic village at the coast was the best choice! The hotel exists since 1913 and can prove it has experience since a long time. The location just so close at the sea is unique. The rating is a four star hotel and in a lot of things you can experience this four stars : a lot of staff that is very friendly to the guests, a very good breakfastbuffet, a nice terrace, good service... But anyway, I have some negative points I like to comment : in our room on the fourth floor the internetconnection was not good, our bed was hard to sleep...the matrass was just on a wooden board - only one star- ! We booked halfboard for our holiday but after three days we cancelled the halfboard ...two times tunafish in three days, an unfriendly waiter that replies it is normal to have the same plate when you stay several days ! No feedback on my complaint from the hotelreception was not so fine! I feel sorry to write this negative points but I want to be honest. So I mentioned the good things as well the bad things.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Nice hotel, in a very good position over looking sea;4;18.05.2016;Luckily it was a beautiful day and we sat on the terrace looking out to sea. Perfect.Car park was a little way from the hotel but they sent a chap to pick us up. Slightly dozy waitress at breakfast which had a large selection and was adequate. We paid L80 for a room without a view which I felt was expensive. It was easy to walk out and find numerous restaurants.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Great location but not the best choice when it comes to service!;2;17.05.2016;I am sorry to write a review where it is difficult to find other reasons to recommend this hotel than the nice location by the sea. As a Top Contributor I have used Tripadvisor for many years finding great hotels around the world. This time it failed for me! The service at this hotel is not on the level of a highly rated hotel. I tried so send an email before arrival with some question but it took 3 days and 2 more emails to get an answer. When we came to the hotel restaurant the first evening at about 09 pm they told us that there had been a group of people earlier that evening and could not serve more customers that evening… and the next morning we had to wait in the reception area because the breakfast restaurant was full. Breakfast was just soso - average coffee and food. It was far from relaxing with so many people trying to get food in a room simply too small for a hotel of that size, and standing in a queue waiting for a morning coffee was no fun!Our room (no 112) has not been upgraded for a long time as you can see on my attached photos. The hotel is quite outdated and the air conditioning has exceeded it’s ‘best by’ date a long time ago.Wifi is very slow and intermittent so if you plan to do transactions online beware that you may lose connections and need to log in again.I have done many reviews on top rated hotels but have never been so disappointed before. Maybe the step from the outstanding hotel Cubo in Ljubljana was too high?

A Very Pleasant Place;5;11.05.2016;From the moment I entered this hotel, I knew it would be great. The young man who assists guests with their luggage and transport to and from the parking garage could not have been more helpful, the whole time with a smile on his face. The young lady behind the desk was also welcoming, happy and gave lots of information. Checkin was done easily and quickly. The room had been renovated, and was in really good condition. It was clean and had everything. Wifi worked well in the room.The buffet breakfast had lots of choice.Even though it was quite wet for my stay, Piran is certainly an intriguing and historic place.

Lovely staff/great location/standard rooms.;4;11.05.2016;While the rooms themselves were a little tired and somewhat basic, the lovely staff and great location more than made up for this. If you're driving you're not allowed to park within Piran itself but you can drive in and right up to the hotel and stop for a short while out front while you check in. The check in staff will then happily direct you to the multi story carpark about 10-15mins walk away (There is a shuttle bus service back should you require). Let them know anyway as they will give you a discounted parking rate if you're staying with them. The reception staff throughout were very friendly and helped us with any questions we had. Breakfast was decent although nothing out of the ordinary. The Hotel itself is wonderfully located on the waterfront right in the centre of charming Piran. Our only real complaint are the rooms which could use an update. Otherwise highly recommend.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Presidential Suite. Great room & excellent views!;5;10.05.2016;We stayed in the Presidential suite (top floor of the hotel) on 29th April 2016. So as you'd expect the room itself was huge, well furnished and had awesome views out over the Adriatic. There is also a good sized balcony and a shower that looks out over the sea, very cool!As we found out pretty quickly Piran is not very car friendly with few spaces, so the best plan is to park at the top of the hill. The hotel will then shuttle you (and your belongings) to and from the car park, and also pay for the parking, a small but nice touch detail.Reception could not have been more helpful and the lobby area is well decorated with a funky little Vespa by the lifts. It's a lovely hotel and right by the sea.One thing worth mentioning is the although Piran is a very pretty seaside town it does not have a 'beach' as such. By that I mean no sandy areas.We did not eat in the Hotel, but I'm sure it would have been good if we had. As the Hotel is on the seafront you can sit on the terrace and watch the sun set with a glass of wine (very nice) and then stroll along the promenade, perfecto! Special mention should go out to reception who looked after us very well, and were polite and helpful at all times. I hope we can visit again soon.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Hotel itself was well presented and i persoanlly loved the decor, it was really nice. The staff were really friendly and happy to help. Parking - we found really easy, park at the top, if you are inclined it's a 10 minute walk or wait for the bus, the hotel offers a reduced rate which I think is really great customer care. Breakfast was included and we found it suited us with a range of cereals, breads, meats, cheeses and fruit. Great stay all round - Piran is a beautiful place.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Location location;4;12.04.2016;This is a nice boutique hotel right on the water in Piran. We were in room 220, considered a junior suite, with a small balcony facing the water. When you look across the bay you can see Croatia.The service is friendly enough, competent. The room was good sized, and actually had two small bathrooms- shower only. Beds were firm, but comfortable. Our room was above the restaurant and we could hear some conversations but nothing that kept us from sleeping at night.This is a nice choice because of the Waterview and it's central location to the Square and waterfront restaurants.

Waterfront hotel;4;3.02.2016;Hotel Piran has a great location on the water in the old town. Perfect location for exploring the back alleys and harbour. There is no parking at the hotel. You need to park outside the old town limit and take the free shuttle to/from the hotel. If you have a hotel reservation you can get a 15 minute pass with your car into the old town to drop off your luggage. Rooms are ok - they are somewhat dated but probably as good as you are going to get in this area. There was a good selection of food available for breakfast.

Just down the street are several good restaurants, and the hotel staff is great with tourist ideas and suggestions for places to eat.

Stunning sunset, Comfortable stay;4;19.12.2015;We had recently spent 3 nights at the Hotel Piran, on the 3rd week of December.We arrived Piran via bus from Ljubljana. It was about 10 minutes walk from the bus station to the hotel (dragging a heavy & noisy luggage through town square )The location of Hotel Piran is excellent - right on the waterfront, next to the restaurants and walking distance to the old town. We had a room on the 3rd floor that looked out to the Gulf of Trieste. The view was so therapeutic. We managed to catch a glorious sunset on our 2nd day.As for the room interiors, I think the bathroom & amenities are more like a 3 star hotel. Wifi is intermittent so if you plan to do transactions online (such as booking of train tickets, hotel etc) beware that you may lose connections and need to log in again.

Best Choice in Piran;5;27.10.2015;We were going from Ljubljana to Venezia and needed a place to stay for a couple of nights in between. We had visited the town a week before on a cruise ship excursion and thought it was very picturesque. Chose the Hotel Piran based on the location, reviews, and the price offered on the internet. Never regretted our decision for a minute.From the moment we walked into the lobby, the service was impeccable. The shuttle bus took us back to the parking garage to pick up our luggage and we had a beachfront room with a small balcony that had an awesome view of the boardwalk, as well as the Adriatic and sunsets. Free wi-fi was pretty decent and the included breakfast was plentiful and varied.

Lovely town, great views from hotel balcony;4;22.10.2015;"Four of us travels to Piran after the refugee crisis thwarted our plans to go to Croatia. Overall, it was a lovely stay because the town is small and beautiful on the Adriatic.

Wonderful to leave doors open at night to hear the waves...best sleep I've had in more than 2 weeks of travel in Central Europe. Professional and pleasant reception staff who were all very helpful. Beautifully appointed, upscale lobby. Great outdoor seating for coffee, drinks or lunch by the sea. Excellent breakfast (smoked salmon!)Cons...hard-as-rock mattresses, shower can be cold-to-lukewarm at best (at 6:30 a.m. the morning we left my shower was cold.) Internet extremely frustrating because it drops constantly. We had dinner in hotel first night because it was \restaurant week\"" and 15 euros for 3 courses...supposedly 55 euros at other times. You get what you pay for. Bland, blah, unappealing. One of the worst meals of the trip. Would we stay again? Probably but not likely to be back this way again.

Great location & views;5;21.10.2015;This hotel is perfectly located hotel in Piran's Old Town. Since Old Town is pedestrian only, most cars have to park above the town in a large public parking lot. We were both met and dropped off at the parking lot by the hotel van. The hotel staff was efficient, helpful, and friendly. Our room, while small, was tastefully decorated and had a nice view of the bay, with a stunning sunset. The hotel is located a few feet from the water which was great as we could just walk outside the hotel and go swimming in the sea.The ample buffet breakfast had both hot & cold choices and could sit outside with the beautiful views while eating same.Our only negative was that the balcony in our room was tiny and way to small. We had a double room but you could only fit one chair on the balcony. In fact our companion had a single room and the balcony in that room was bigger that ours !!!!!However the pros far outweigh that small detail and would highly recommend this hotel;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Average and outdated;3;17.10.2015;The hotel can be reached by car. Upon checking in guests are accompanied to a parking garage just outside the city center and taken back to the hotel by shuttle-bus. The hotel is quite outdated and the air conditioning has exceeded it’s ‘best by’ date a long time ago. At temperatures of around 40 degrees there was no way to achieve a bearable temperature in the room. The room itself and the bathroom are adequate and from the small balcony the view over the Adriatic Sea is splendid.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
EXCELLENT FOOD;5;17.10.2015;"First of all we haven't stayed at hotel but we had a lunch at their restaurant. It was in occasion of \The week of restaurants \"" when the chefs offer a three course meals at a single (low) price. We must say that the food was super delicious, the staff super friendly and professional. Thay also offered us a free shuttle to parking garage at the end and paid our parking ticket.

Great location just don't expect a quiet stay;3;17.10.2015;Hotel Piran is a comfortable hotel with good service. Fabulous views if you have a sea view room. The hotel offers a convenient shuttle service to and from the car park. It fell down in two areas for us - breakfast was just soso. Average coffee and food, could be much better. The biggest disappointment for us was coming home on a Thursday evening at 8pm to hear the 'doof doof' of a party being held directly one floor above us at the hotel. We rang reception to be told it would stop at 10pm. When I complained that we had specifically requested a quiet room when we booked, and a sea view room so we could hear the sound of the sea, I felt I was treated very patronisingly by the receptionist. Not apologetic at all, she said that normally these parties would finish at 12pm so we should be happy it was finishing at 10pm, and that it was Piran, and there would be noise anywhere. If this was the case, the hotel should have notified me when I booked that I would not be getting a quiet room as it was not possible. Anyway, to the hotel's credit, we were changed rooms quickly, but this was highly inconvenient and unsettling on our last night. So if you want guaranteed quiet, apparently don't stay here.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
A beautiful one night stay;5;16.10.2015;"During a trip to Slovenia we decided to travel to Piran for a very quick trip. The Hotel Piran is a beautiful hotel. The rooms were in front of the hotel, with balconies overlooking the Adriatic Sea. Thankfully, our first day there, the weather was perfect! After a day of walking around, we enjoyed a small night time snack. Their chocolate \mouse\"" was excellent. The breakfast was very good. While the room was lovely, and the bed was comfortable, the pillows were lacking.

Hard to beat this waterfront hotel in Old Town;5;13.10.2015;We spent one night at this perfectly located hotel in Piran's Old Town. Since Old Town is pedestrian only, most cars have to park above the town in a large public parking lot. We were both met and dropped off at the parking lot by the hotel van. The hotel staff was efficient, helpful, and friendly. Our room, while small, was tastefully decorated and had a nice view of the bay, with a stunning sunset. The hotel is located a few feet from the water, and all the Old Town's charms, restaurants, and shops are close by. The ample buffet breakfast, which was included in the room price, was the equal of any we had on our three week trip through Slovenia and Croatia. We had a really nice stay here, and recommend it to anyone visiting Piran.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

A Wonderful Hotel with a Spectacular View At the Door;5;28.09.2015;We only had a short stay here but I would gladly come again and stay longer. The hotel is splendid and the view can't be beat. Out the back of the hotel the sea is seconds away. Out the front door you are minutes from the old town and the square of Piran. We love it. The room was an adequate size and the bath was fine. I would have loved a tub but, it's Europe. The rooftop terrace has a wonderful view each evening of the sunset and the coastline. The breakfast provided was large and really good with many choices for healthy eating as well as standard breakfast fare. The staff was very helpful and cheerful and the shuttle up to the parking lot out of Old Town was prompt and frequent. If you are in Piran you need to stay at Hotel Piran. It couldn't have been better.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
A delightful stay at a delightful hotel in a delightful town.;5;27.09.2015;We arrived in Piran by rental car knowing very little about the town and how to get around. We were greeted by a very friendly, knowledgeable staff who guided us through the parking situation expertly, and got us quickly settled into a wonderful room with an expansive balcony overlooking the Adriatic and nearby town. Our 2 day stay there was fabulous, and I would not hesitate to stay at the Hotel Piran again if I ever get back that way.

Stayed for a week, and didn't find anywhere better to eat in Piran. The rooftop bar is a nice place to watch a sunset - naturally you pay for the luxury and exclusivity.We had two adjoining family rooms which worked well, except it was unusually hot outside and the aircon was only in one of the rooms . Yes, there's a few little signs of wear & tear in the rooms, but this is a seaside holiday resort hotel - not a city boutique, so all within expectation.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Wonderful old hotel on harbour front;5;24.09.2015;This is a lovely hotel right on the waterfront of beautiful pedestrianized town of Piran. The shuttle bus too & from the hotel from the park & ride car park at the edge of town was easy & v frequent. The lobby is spacious, there is a lift to all floors & has both seafront bar/restaurant & roof top bar. Roof top prices a little steep for here but both areas have wonderful views & you can watch the sunset over the sea. Staff were extremely helpful, friendly & informative & had excellent English. Our room was at the back which meant a little noisy in the mornings with delivery vans & refuse collection. We had to open the shutter windows as the air con didn't really have much effect. Also for apparently recently refurbished rooms the beds were quite basic, the shower head a single hand held type & with only one upright wooden chair to sit on.However I highly recommend this hotel for its location, its staff & its wonderful plentiful buffet breakfast.

First Class All The Way!;5;17.09.2015;You can't beat the setting of this wonderful hotel on the Adriatic Sea. We arrived 10 minutes after 3pm and they very apologetically said our room was not yet available. They told us to go out on the patio and have a free drink on hotel, where we enjoyed the scenic view. Our room was ready a half hour later and as a courtesy they bumped us up to what looked like a Presidential Suite! All the staff was kind and friendly. The restaurant and bar were also exceptional.

3 Star, not 4 Star Hotel;2;17.09.2015;"If we had booked here as a 3 star hotel, we wouldn't have been quite so disappointed. In our opinion, this does not meet expectations of a 4 star accommodation. We even booked a \superior\"" room. Lighting was poor in the room, making reading difficult. Carpet was wet under the air conditioner upon entering the room. Large dirty spot on carpet by the bed. A small desk with one chair, so a second person is forced to use the bed as a chair. Soap bar fell through the wide slats of the shower shelf (which was bent downward). It was also difficult to put a bar of soap on the sink, as it kept sliding into the sink (I finally just placed the soap on its wrapper and it stayed in place). No place to put clothes while showering, despite the bathroom being quite large. An extra chair or low shelf would have been nice. The Internet was hit and miss, and would spontaneously disconnect every 20 minutes or so. Very often we couldn't enjoy our patio overlooking the beach, as cigarette smoke forced us to close our door (we were on ground floor and we asked to move up a floor or two, but there were no available rooms). On a positive note, the front desk staff (the men) were very friendly and helpful.They greeted us warmly and were wonderful. The rooms were clean (except for the dirty carpet spot by the bed). Breakfast was great, with a wide selection of good tasting food. We had a couple very hot days, but our room stayed a comfortable temperature.

Nice hotel;3;12.09.2015;We stayed at HP for 6 nights recently. The hotel is really nice and the location is perfect. The staff were also very polite and helpful. We were really looking forward to having a massage and a drink at the roof bar, until we saw the prices! Such prices cannot be justified. There are enough places within a 2 minute walk to get a nice drink at normal Slowenian prices. No wonder that we were alone at the roof bar!Breakfast was great although between 08:30 - 09:30 it was far from relaxing with so many people trying to get food in a room simply too small for a hotel of that size, and standing in a queue waiting for a morning coffee was no fun! Sea view balcony would have been perfect if it wasn't for the 07:00am sport group laughing and clapping directly outside our window EVERY morning. No fault of the hotel though!

Stunning setting;4;6.09.2015;We enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Piran. The best thing about the hotel is the location with the sea right outside the door and a view you could never tire of. The hotel itself has an old fashioned quality to it and has been around for a while. The rooms are therefore a little dated despite a fairly recent refurbishment. The size of the room is fine and there is plenty of storage. The air con worked fine while we were there. There was a good selection on offer for breakfast. The other major plus is the modern roof terrace where you can watch the sunset while sipping a cocktail which was fabulous. Piran itself is stunning and the hotel is just minutes from Tartini Square and close to a number of restaurants and bars.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
HOTEL BY THE SEA;4;5.09.2015;Stayed at Hotel Piran for 3 nights. Great location and reasonable prices TIP dont forget departure city tax of 1.26 euro per person per night. Also if you can get a sea view its much better as the city views are eally just of the alley or parking lot behind the hotel. We had room 201 which is located next to a maintenance room and all night you can here machinery buzzing or bleeping - not conjusive for a good nights sleep. Staff were friendly and helpful but hotel fully booked so no other options.Breakfast ok but long ques for coffee machine which was very tempramental.

Wonderful hotel, wonderful location;4;3.09.2015;It did not get a 5 star because we could not get a water view room with a balcony and that to me would have been a 5 star. The hotel is conveniently located to the city center where the shuttle drops you off from the parking lot. The staff is beyond nice and helpful. They REALLY want you to have a good experience. The room was large, clean and although we had street view, very quiet. The bathroom was roomy and clean with great water pressure and lots of hot water. The breakfast is fantastic. You can sit outside by the water, with a gorgeous view and people watch. The buffet had great variety and everything was hot and fresh. We also rented bikes from the hotel for only 5 euro for a few hours which was the highlight of our trip. We were able to go all the way to Croatia along the coast. The first night we arrived, the gentleman at the front desk suggested Restaurant Neptune, which I have to say was one of the best meals of your trip.The only two negatives are: They were a bit understaffed at breakfast and there was a bit of a long wait for your coffee. In my opinion if they let you go up and get your own coffee things may flow better. AND their air conditioning system is on a set schedule and can not be turned on even if a heat wave came at an unexpected time. The hotel staff was very apologetic for this and really tried to explain. I really didn't mind, I just asked cause it was just a little warm. Overall, it's a great place.

Great location, lovely staff.;4;2.09.2015;Ok the rooms are pretty average, not very spacious but the views are unbeatable! Bathroom a bit tiny too, but the place was spotless. We were there during a rather cool spell in August so we didn't have to use the aircon day or night! The breakfast was very pleasant,although a little chaotic with the layout but the lovely staff couldn't do enough to help and always ready to spare a minute to chat to the guests. We were just staying bed and breakfast but we found the evening meals at the hotel were exceptional, in fact the best in town . Great chef, very inventive! The rooftop bar was very attractive with the best view ever but felt the prices a bit steep, 2 gins + 1 tonic 17.50 euros, no crisps/nuts either! It would be good to have a bit of a character barman serving them too..... So we would certainly stay recommend the hotel, the location in this fabulous old town is unbeatable and there's a great buzz about the place both inside and on the sea front.

Good little hotel ;3;31.08.2015;Great location, breakfast and staff... However, the rooms need new mattresses and pillows. I barely slept for three hours with a noisy air-conditioning as well.

From the balcony to the see.;4;24.08.2015;Probably the best accommodation place in Piran. You feel like you may jump to the see from your balcony. The view is unforgettable. The recently renovated rooms are not equipped with unnecessary luxury but they have everything what you need for a couple of days stay. The staff is young, professional and multilingual. The breakfast offer is satisfactory, the location is beautiful. Highly recommended. The hotel shuttle is quick and flexible.Dislikes:- the elevator is old and very slow- pigeons will taste your breakfast directly from your plate- a group of people has chosen the beach in front of the hotel for their morning exercise.

Outstanding location;4;17.08.2015;We adored staying at Hotel Piran and can't imagine having stayed anywhere else in the town. The location simply cannot be beat - it is literally right on the water, you walk out the back door and there are chairs lined up for sunning. As a hotel guest you can reserve a chair/umbrella the day before for a small fee, which is very much worth it. The breakfast was fabulous (with outdoor seating on the water) and the staff was gracious and especially helping getting us back and forth to our car parked in the garage (which sounds complicated but they also make this simple for you). The room itself was spacious (we had a suite with balcony) though a bit dated in terms of decor and the wifi was a bit slow at times.

Best place to stay on the Slovenian coast!;4;13.08.2015;Stayed here in August 2015 and it was HOT. If you are staying on the coast and want a boutique hotel experience right on the water, then this is your place. Originally we were going to stay at the Kempinski in Potoroz, but wanted something on the water in a more charming location. We travelled with young children, grandparents, and everyone in between, and Hotel Piran was a great choice. Definitely get a room facing the water with a balcony-incredible views and fun to sit outside with a drink from the bar. Restaurant was wonderful and convenient-great food, drinks and service-we ate here for almost every meal and heat-busting smoothies in the afternoon. Family friendly and excellent local fish. Hard to get closer to the sea than this hotel, although there is a reservation system with the chairs, even if you are a guest. (And the reservation lasts all day, even when people have left...bizarre.)Would have given it 5 stars but the rooms could use a redo-they don't match the charming exterior and public rooms of the hotel. Beds can be a bit hard. Regardless, would definitely choose this hotel again!;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Hard to find fault;5;13.08.2015;Excellent location, just the right level of service, friendly and helpful reception. Breakfast is spot on and the views from the outside restaurant are just great. Bar on the top floor is great for an early evening aperitif before dinner. The only slight blot on the landscape is the ugly façade on the street side of the extension - but overall that's very minor.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Wonderful location, very nice staff.;5;12.08.2015;When we arrived at the location what jumped into our eyes immediately is, that the ocean was just 3 meters away from our apartment. The staff was a very nice bunch, everybody was helpful and welcoming. The room was kept tidy and in order. We were on the bottom floor and the balcony was placed just so that if we wished to move on we just threw our stuff over the fence and went on walking in the city. The view was incredible and the top floor restaurant had a great view of the whole pearl that is Piran. All in all, it's a bit more expensive than the other hotels in Piran, but oh boy, it's worth it to the max. I highly recommend staying there!;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
View from the room is five star;4;12.08.2015;It may be the best location in town. Our room with a balcony and view of the sea was just what we wanted when we came to Piran. The rooms and amenities are not luxury. The phone in the room was broken and so was the lock on the sliding balcony windows, but they assured me that no one would break into the room! Would have liked a robe in the room.The breakfast was great, and loved sitting along the waterfront.The top floor bar was closed because it was off season, but we appreciated that they escorted us up to take photos. Almost all the front staff desk were friendly and helpful. There was one gentleman particularly accommodating and I gave him a little present from home as a thank you.They called a restaurant for us to be sure that we could get in. The loaner bicycles are a nice touch. There is a bike/walking path along the water that goes for miles. It was a highlight of the visit.For the location and view, would stay here again.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Great hotel would recommend, with just a few minor quibbles;4;11.08.2015;"Although we had visited Piran on day trips during previous visits to Slovenia, this was our first proper stay in Piran. We arrived for 5 nights on a very warm evening at the end of July. As there were six of us in our party, I had emailed ahead to ask if we could have three rooms next to each other on a high floor and had received an email from a lady called Dagmar, saying this was possible and would be arranged. We were checked in by Haris, an extremely friendly and welcoming man; nevertheless I was somewhat disappointed to find that the rooms were on the 2nd floor and were not all next to each other, even though I had requested this a year in advance; Haris was very apologetic but we made it perfectly clear to him that this was not his fault. The rooms were very tastefully decorated although extremely warm, due to the air conditioning units not being particularly effective; this was the case throughout our stay, so we ended up sleeping with the patio door (which had no locking device on it) open all night. Luckily the rooms did have safes in the wardrobe for valuables. We had hired a car from Ljubljana airport and when we arrived in Piran we drove through the town barrier (usually reserved for locals) right up to the hotel. Once unloaded, we drove back to garage 'fornace' where we parked the car for the duration of our stay. Transport between the garage and hotel was then by courtesy vehicle, driven by a member of hotel staff; this was a very efficient service, although we also had the options of walking (10-15 minutes) or using the free shuttle bus from nearby Tartini Square. Breakfast was very good, with plenty of hot and cold selections and a choice of inside or outside seating; the staff in the restaurant were always very friendly and helpful. The hotel was located right on the main promenade, with beautiful views out to sea if, like us, you booked sea-view rooms with balconies, and glorious sunsets to admire. We tend to use our holiday hotel as a base to explore the local region: Hotel Piran is the perfect place for this if you want to discover not only Slovenia, but northern Croatia too, where Kuna is the currency, not the Euro; Piran itself is a delightful town to wander around, with the narrow streets throwing up many a surprise, whether a new restaurant to try, or a church or monastery to look at. A hike up to the old town walls offers fabulous views at any time of day. Whilst based in Piran we also visited several places in Croatia, such as Rovinj, a very beautiful and worthwhile town to visit about 1 1/4 hours drive, Pula which had a magnificent amphitheatre and other Romanesque sights, also about 1 1/4 hours drive and Motovun, a little town high up on a hill, a 50km drive away - well worth visiting, but a morning arrival is advisable, due to the volume of people arriving later. Getting back through the Croatia/Slovenia border was a little time consuming in the afternoon though, due to the volume of traffic. We also visited Izola on the public bus, which was very easy to do from the bus station, where there was good information available regarding buses to all destinations. We hired bikes from the hotel and biked to Portoroz, a very enjoyable flat round trip of about 5km. We did not eat dinner in the hotel, but tried various restaurants such as Pavel 2 on our first night, as it was just along from the hotel; but our favourite was Restaurant Verdi, where we ate more than once. This was tucked out of the way down a side alley, but the food, staff and ambience made a very special night out. The fish plate for two was delicious and the cevapcicci with the local rice and vegetables dish was lovely. We also ate in Pizzeria Pettica, which was very good too. We had a very successful trip to hotel Piran and would highly recommend it to anyone; it was fantastic value for money and worthy of its 4* rating. 5 nights just didn't seem long enough, but luckily this was only half of our holiday, so we travelled onto Grand Hotel Toplice on Lake Bled for the rest of the trip.";Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Great location;4;7.08.2015;The room was well appointed and we could see St George's Church from the window. It is easy to walk to from the bus station and to other parts of town. A popular swimming spot is from the rocks right outside.

Nothing is too much trouble;5;2.08.2015;Stayed for 3 days in Hotel Piran at the end of July. Communication with the hotel was excellent before we arrived and our room request of a double sea view room on an upper floor was met. There are no cars allowed on Piran peninsula but you can drive to the hotel to drop your luggage and then someone from the hotel will follow you out to the parking garage just outside the town and bring you back to the hotel. There is a bar on the roof of the hotel which gives spectacular views of the sunset whilst enjoying a cocktail. We also ate at the restaurant on the ground floor and the food is of high quality and service was excellent.The room was not that big and the bathroom whilst small was fine for what we needed. The air conditioning wasn't powerful and we could not see any controls to adjust enough to cool the whole room. When the bathroom door was open the room could get quite humid. The free wi-fi was ok and fine for what we needed but there is an option to upgrade if you needed.At Breakfast there was loads of choice - fruit, cereals, continental and hot options which you could eat inside or out on the terrace overlooking the sea. Overall the hotel was excellent and offered everything we needed during our stay in Piran.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Nice hotel;4;30.07.2015;"We stayed here four nights and were quite happy with the hotel. Location is good, right at the sea-front. Breakfast is good, and staff at the reception very helpful. Our sea-view room was quite basic and smallish, but very clean. Toilet was functional and spacious but could have had some more shelves for toiletries. Hotel offers wifi but it didn't work very well in the room. Rooms have an effective air-conditioning; it's worth noting that the AC is adjustable but the control panel is hidden below a cover and you may easily miss it, unless you know where to look for (ask the reception for help in this). There was some noise (mainly children having fun and some music from the nearby restaurants) from the street below. Closing the balcony doors helped very well in this and the noise didn' really bother us. We would stay at this hotel again, if in Piran.";Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Needing Some Extra Touches So Much;3;28.07.2015;Pros: • Superb and even romantic location, especially when the sea shows its might. • Friendly and helpful reception, same holds for all staff we have met during our short stays. • Well organized minibus free transportation to the sizeable garage Fornaèe (take care, not designed for truly big cars). • A nice selection of Slovenian wines by glass in the bar/restaurant. • Perfectly served draft beer.Cons: • Hotel is far more *** than **** considering the standard room size, while price certainly is very much four star even through booking.com (150 EUR per night for a double). Very basic! • Bathroom sizeable enough, but very poorly designed (toilet right by the wall, where to put the other leg?), and even more poorly equipped – nobody thought of a place (a chair might do!) to put on even one toilet bag, the shower soap holder can not hold the free toiletry as it falls right through due to small diameter. • Check-out time very early (11AM). • The »hotel beach« is actually a public beach with some hotel sunchairs controlled by an employee, but the hundreds of tourists and locals passing by the beach between the hotel and the sea (some 7-8 meters space) have every right to share the space – a matter of national legislation rather than the hotel management. • The comfortable staircase into the sea is life-threateningly slippery (applying a simple brush once per three days, 5-10 minutes time, would solve the issue). • Food quality highly mediocre based on my experience (this year a huge microwave heated »Piran Lasagna«), though rumours have it it is far better at proper dinner time. • Last, but surely not least, the (free) WiFi is a complete disaster.With all the unnecessary mistakes it still is the best hotel in Piran. Sadly, this is not so difficult… Piran is a lovely medieval town. There could be so many high level small boutique hotels and a corresponding tourist level, demanding also high level cuisine. Neither the imported population with no relation to the town's rich cultural past, nor the municipality elected accordingly, are up to it. So Hotel Piran is still one of the brightest spots by far.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Lovely views but could do better;3;27.07.2015;We had high expectations of the Hotel Piran given the reviews and its own website but it didn't quite live up to them. To start with the positives, the view from our room was excellent, communication by email was very good beforehand and our room request was met (for a sea view on the top floor to try to minimise noise from the seafront). Breakfast was very good and can be taken on the outside terrace just by the sea. I didn't mind the swimming area being public, and appreciated the steps down. We didn't bother with sunbeds once we discovered this was extra. However, the room was not as good as it should have been for the price: furniture was quite basic melamine finish, the toilet seat slipped, the shower room was not luxurious, there were scuffs and a strangely non matching repainted bit on the walls and there were dirty carpets in the hallways. The air-conditioning was really not effective. Other things are more a matter of personal taste. I personally do not like constant piped music by the lifts and the music form the rooftop bar was so off putting we didn't visit it (and why doesn't the website say this bar is only open in the evenings?) I can only assume others like the music but I am glad our room wasn't near it (we did have music from a beach front bar, though: i recommend ear plugs as Piran is a lively spot in summer) Despite all the above, we enjoyed our stay and Piran itself is beautiful. However, the contrast with the Grand hotel Ljubljana where we paid a similar amount and had perfect room and service was marked. There our room was made up while we were at breakfast, always a mark of a hotel on top of its game. Here we were disturbed after we had been out for several hours and come back for a rest. If the price was lower, I wouldn't expect as much, but a 4 start hotel needs to get the basics right to impress.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

If something is not working, they send somebody to fix it immediately. The rooms are however a bit overpriced for the value offered: not very big, simple decoration, carpet is dirty, airco cannot cope with the hot weather. Also the advertisement of a 'private beach' is not quite what it suggest. There is a concrete area in front of the hotel where you can rent beds and an umbrella (Eur 5 each for a day). Towels are for free for hotel guests. This is however a public area. The swimming facilities are minimal. There are steps into the water, but these are slippery and the sea is full of sharp stones/rocks. Watershoes are recommended! Not suitable for small children! You also have to pay for a fresh water shower. If you arrive during the day you have to lay on the pavement with no shade since all the beds are reserved. A bit disappointing all in all.

Great location and service;4;17.07.2015;We stayed here in early July in a sea view room on the fist floor. The hotel has a lot to offer - good rooms in a great location and lots more.The rooms are well equipped and the view was superb - especially during an overnight thunderstorm, which was the most amazing shoe of nature's power. Everything is modern and as expected in a hotel of this standard. Breakfast offers a good choice of juices, breads, cheese, ham,cereals etc. a new coffee machine arrived mid week, but I fear this was a backward step from the waiter service. It is little things like this that make a difference. We chose to eat out so can't comment on other meals. There is a lot of choice around. Our only disappointment was the meal at Pavel, whereas Restaurant Verdi was superb.Staff were always helpful and attentive - even down to finding some glue to fix a flip flop the had come apart while walking the uneven promenade.All I in all a great week in a lovely town.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Best hotel in Piran;5;13.07.2015;We stayed here for two nights in June and we did not want to leave.

I cannot give the staff enough kudos, we had problems with our hire car and issues outlining the problem to the company due to the language barrier. The staff at reception were happy to play translator and let us use their phones as well as offer advice when needed in dealing with this issue. I would happily return to Hotel Piran not just for the hotel but also for the restaurant, which offered delicious food and wine and also served drinks to the thirsty sunbakers sitting out the front.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Weekend in Piran;4;11.07.2015;Hotel is nicely renovated and has a bar outside by the sea and on the rooftop which is cool. Breakfast is served in the bar by the beach which we liked. Rooms are OK and rank for a four star hotel. Service in the hotel is very good. In my view this hotel is probably the nicest among the four star hotels on the Slovenian coast. We had a dinner in hotel's restaurant, which was very good. The only problem is that it is very noisy during the night because of the surrounding bars and early in the morning, since there are already many people on the beach and in the town.

Lovely hotel in brilliant location;4;5.07.2015;Piran is a little gem of a place. It is a pretty town near Portoroz and is easy to reach from Trieste in Italy.This hotel has very good staff who are friendly, helpful and efficient.Breakfast is excellent-lots to choose from and it is great to eat overlooking the sea. Lunch and supper were lovely too-there is an excellent wine list and the food is good. My only reservations are: a very small lift, and bedrooms are basic with insufficient attention to detail. The soap dish in the shower fails to hold anything! The shower is basic too though it does work. More shelving in the bathrooms would help. Wifi is intermittent-it works but you need to to renew it frequently. My single room resembled a student room really-it was comfortable but again, nothing extraneous.- the chairs on the balcony were so uncomfortable. But the views more than compensated. I would recommend this hotel because in the kind of weather we had rooms were only for sleeping in! The beach isn't one really but you can book your lounger for I think 5Euroa a day and a towel comes too but no cushions and the loungers are not overly comfortable. You lie in the sun and walk down some steps into a blissfully cool sea. The lower steps are slippery so care is needed and getting into the sea is tricky when the tide is going out. Kids come en masses when school finishes. People are friendly and it is just so beautiful-if you are lucky on a good day you can see Venice!;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Having stayed in my fair share of hotel's this isn't a 4 star. The rooms are not only small (and our bathroom in room 216 was more like a cupboard. ) but they have seen better days for somewhere that was renovated 2 years ago. If you have suitcases there's not really much room to put them. The shower was a little grubby and when using the rain shower which required the use of a bottle opener to turn on. ..not a lot of water came out. I then spent several minutes picking at the rain shower holes where the water comes from which were blocked up hence the water not even coming out or spraying awkwardly at random places. A little viakal would help. The shower whilst having a rain shower mix ..as already mentioned we needed to use the bottle opener (provided in the room) to manoeuvre the switch. They do provide toiletries but no hair conditioner which most 4 star's would. These were replenished daily.Towels were a little threadbare. And because the bathroom was so small it didn't really have anywhere to hang towels once used to get them to dry. The balcony floor was a hazard. With loose wooden tiles which i twisted my ankle on the first night. I tried to report it but the phone in the room didn't work. Not a big deal. Reported it on our way out but on our return nothing had been done except the loose tiles put back in their place. The phone remains not working.Next morning having removed and piled up the loose tiles myself i reported it again. (We paid extra for a sea view to have the balcony) this time thankfully someone had relayed the tiles securely (In most places). Phone still not working. But I did wander to reception to thank the staff for fixing the floor. The bed in the other hand was very comfy. And nice clean white cotton sheets. If you like a solid mattress you'll be ok.Aircon is provided but again there is no control for the individual rooms. So it's on at a level and that's it. For a 4 star you'd at least expect controllable aircon.For another plus though the windows are very sound proof which is handy as the area outside of the hotel does get busy and noisy.Breakfast is ok. But a little disorganised. You find a place to sit. After some time you may get offered coffee. (Which are freshly made and very good.) But frustratingly cutlery isn't always provided on tables. Having picked my breakfast items and sat down i had nothing to eat it with. Not a problem as I could go get them myself but on trying to find a knife and fork I was told 'twice' they would be provided. Waited and waited and then went behind the bar myself to get them. .but by this time breakfast was cold. So make sure you have something to eat with 'before' you select your food.Some of staff serving breakfast were good but can't tell you who as most just had badges saying 'trainee'Just 3 choices of cereal and croissants as the only choice of pastry. Usual affair of meats, 'cheese and bread. Hot items not cooked to order. Eg eggs no choice of omelette. .if there was this was never offered. Another minus is that you have to pay for sun loungers and umbrellas which are very limited. Beachtowels on the other hand are free. Just ask at reception. The guy servicing the sun loungers was very polite and worked hard (just from my observation as I just sat on the wall)There is a mini bar in the room but prices are high. Another 4 star hotel we stayed at in Ljubljana Hotel Cubo provided the mini bar for free. Okay we paid €440 for 3 nights here but this was far superior than Hotel Piran on all levels. Just take a look for yourselves at my review.We paid €408 for 3 nights to stay here and my husband and I didn't think it was worth it. Sorry Hotel Piran. Perhaps some of your other rooms are 4 star but room 216 isn't. This was our 6th hotel of our mini one month break round Europe and the most disappointing. (2 more to go)On check out we weren't asked how our stay had been but we're asked twice of we'd had anything from the mini bar. The hotel has good and bad points. Would I stay here again. .probably not.Piran is a beautiful small town with winding streets. A grand main square and the walk up to the wall is worth it for the view. Take a €1 per person to access the gates for the gorgeous views. And spray some bug spray if you're going there as I got well and truely bitten on my legs ..hubby didn't but I do tend to get bitten a lot.Plenty of places to eat and lots of seafood on offer. Pretty buildings, harbour and clear waters. Easy to get to via bus from ljubljana .recommend that you book your seat on the bus in advance. We didn't but there were only 8 left on the 10.10am from ljubljana. I imagine I high season they'll get booked up quickly.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Great place to stay;4;1.07.2015;We stayed at the Piran Hotel for 2 nights and there is nothing negative I could say about it...the room was spacious, the bed was comfortable and we had a balcony facing the promenade/water. The staff was helpful and the breakfast was really something to look forward to..Because the Hotel is directly on the promenade it is not exactly suited for people who don't like noise in the evenings/nights and mornings but that didn't bother us.

Get the sea view rooms;3;30.06.2015;We stayed here for two nights in June. Great location on the promenade by the sea. The receptions staff very helpful. We had a car parked at the remote city garage and the hotel provided a shuttle to the garage. Breakfast was good with table outside by the sea wall. Coffee, espresso, etc. had to be ordered from the waiters which took a while at times given all the guests at breakfast.Our room had a small balcony and a couple of chairs. It made a good place to hang clothes to dry. The room were fairly spartan and tiny bathroom. Our air conditioner did not work. We complained and a fellow promptly came up to tinker with it, but it still did not work. It was cooler with the balcony door opened. If it had been warmer, it would have been unacceptable. The balcony door had a missing locking mechanism and could not be secured when we were out. No refrigerator in the room. The roof-top bar had a great view, but prohibitive drink prices which discouraged lingering for a second or third drink. In sum, a five star location and a three star hotel. It could use a lot of maintenance if our room was representative of most of the rooms.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Just writing this review makes me want to go back;5;29.06.2015;The only problem with my stay was that it wasn't longer! I booked a single room so it was a smaller, basic room but it was just fine for just me. Although the room was smaller, the balcony I had was one of the larger ones and had a lounge chair and a regular chair to sit on. I had incredible views out to the sea and of the city. I wish I had planned another day so I could have spent more time enjoying time on out here. Breakfast was good and there was seating outside right along the walkway, so of course I took a seat outside and enjoyed the view of the water and the people watching. I could have sat here much longer than I did as well. Parking is outside the city, but you can drive in to unload your bags and get checked in. I did this and the reception offered to drive my car to the parking lot for me since the shuttle was away at the moment. I let them do this and then picked up my key from them later. On checkout the shuttle was ready for me within 5 minutes and drove me right to were my car was parked. I will absolutely stay here again if I return to Piran, I will just make sure I book more days here. This is one of those hotels where enjoying time in the hotel is part of the experience.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Very pretty;3;29.06.2015;Came here with friends on a five day holiday, hotel very nicely situated and comfortable also very clean. Unfortunately there I no private area for sun bathing so the general public are walking right next to your sunbeds, no waiter service whilst on your sunbeds and when you are in the eating area the staff though helpful are a little on the slow side. On the plus side you have lovely views whilst eating your breakfast . Roof terrace is lovely when its not windy but expensive, the restaurants in the town are ok, all sell relatively the same meals at the same kind of prices, all in all an ok place.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Stay at Hotel Piran;4;28.06.2015;My wife and I stayed at the hotel for 5 nights at the end of a two week self drive holiday round Slovenia.The location of the hotel is excellent. We would recommend a sea view with balcony.We booked half board which we would not now recommend. The service was only average and we were restricted to the time of the meal...between 7.30 and 8.00 pm.There are some very good restaurants in the town which offer a wide range of meals. The restaurant Pia Mari very close to the local Bus Station is outstanding.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Excellent location but book a sea view room;4;26.06.2015;We had an excellent 3 night stay here and we would certainly book here again as we think this is the best hotel in Piran. Great for relaxing and superb location by the waters edge, could not be better. Piran such a lovely place to visit and explore on foot. Great value for money.The hotel is an important part of the stay so very important you have the room you require. We had booked a sea view room with balcony but on arrival we were allocated room 116. This was not acceptable as it was small, the bathroom like a closet, and it had a closed concrete balcony. We immediately saw Meteja in reception and she was most helpful and explained the hotel was full in the coming days as it was a public independence holiday, but she was able to give us room 410 which was ideal but only has a small balcony as has most double rooms apart from the first floor. However Meteja gave us free use of the waterside (beach) loungers and umbrella which was reserved for us each day (well worth having, normally 10 euros per day which we think is expensive).The room was spacious and we had the balcony doors open all the time and what a view! The bed was average, could be better, the bathroom very good with good size walk in shower (the shower head could be updated to give a larger spray).Wifi reception was complimentary and ok. Aircon in room but we did not need this.We found all the staff very friendly and welcoming and very helpful and Metejain particularly good and efficient. Restaurant staff excellent as well and very good service. The guy in charge of the loungers again very friendly and helpful.On the first morning we discovered our shower head was broken and I reported this at Reception. This was at 0625 and he said it would be repaired at 8am but in meantime we could use the shower in the next room to us as it was empty that morning. The shower was repaired at 8am so full marks to the hotel for this.Great to have breakfast outside and by the waters edge, so much better than indoors, selection for breakfast I would rate as average to good (fried eggs though and hot food not kept hot properly and are cold).Coffee served and is good.The hotel has a very nice feel about it and matches the area perfectly.We would love to return but we would request one of the large open balcony rooms with sea view if possible. The suites have this and are ideal for families with children.The restaurant provides a good brunch/lunch as well as evening meals and very good value. It's good to be able to have coffees and light meals at such a low price compared to say Italy which is close by.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Overnight in Piran;3;22.06.2015;Very nice small town - on the coast but with a view of the alps. The hotel has an excellent location in the old town (cars have to be parked outside the town).

Nice Hotel But.....;3;12.06.2015;This is a very nice hotel. Great location in Piran. It's unfortunate that the staff isn't more accommodating. They were friendly at check-in but it went down hill after that. We had a couple of issues that required several requests from us before anything was done about them. And there were never any apologies. Things happen, we know - but when the staff has a bad attitude (arrogant) - it makes the stay less pleasant. Would stay somewhere else next time.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Seaside Rooms Worth the Price;5;10.06.2015;Loved our stay here, although when they party on the waterfront, you can hear it in the room - unless you close the windows. I'm sure it's the same or worse anywhere you stay in Piran, so you might as well choose to stay here, it's the best.Staff pay attention to details and handle requests promptly, including a mattress pad for my bed, which I found to be a touch too hard. Everyone else was happy with their beds, as provided, so I was the odd ball. Parking was offsite, but very well managed so you're not too inconvenienced. Breakfast is excellent, and the front desk very helpful. Computer available for use, where I found & printed our via-Michelin touring routes. Cannot think of any expectation that was not met. Falling asleep to the sound of the water, and having morning coffee overlooking the bay - priceless!

Beautiful location! ;5;30.05.2015;Piran is a beautiful town and was further enhanced by our choice of accommodation. We had a sea view room, and it was just stunning. (Our bathroom was rather tiny, but all rooms are different ). The staff were very helpful, prompt at picking us up on the outskirts of the town, friendly at reception and helpful at breakfast . The breakfast buffet was extensive and freshly made coffees were available. It is certainly a popular location and I would thoroughly recommend it.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Best choice in town;5;29.05.2015;I stumbled on this hotel as I was driving from Italy to Croatia but needed a place to spend the night in between, and what a find! the hotel is in a great location, managed and run by super friendly staff. The rooms are OK in terms of size and amenities - however, the view does compensate.The staff were kind to park my car for the night - as I was exhausted and the parking is out of Piran (you shuttle back and forth with parking shuttle bus). The food in the restaurant was special.The only area of improvement is related to the wifi - you have to sign in agin and again in the free wifi - which is annoying and it does not support VPN!;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Everyone seems to be super nice, from cleaning staff, waiters, and receptionists. Hotel is also located at the best possible location… Hotel is nice elegant and clean. Funny detail, no way to lose keys because key chain is so heavy and big: ) Rooms aren't big, but nothing is big in Piran, so its ok.

Not a 4 star hotel;2;21.05.2015;"We stayed at hotel Piran for one night. When we arrived it looked promising: the lobby was cute, and it is located right by the water; perfect location, and good breakfast, but that was the only positive thing about the hotel. Cons:1. We were given room 203. The room was very dark, with very little natural light.2. The bathrooms were very dirty, and gritty. Not up to par to even some 3 star hotels. In need for major renovation!3. Our A/C unit was not working in the room. It was very hot and musty. Since we were only staying for one night, we sweated it out since we are not the type to complain about things. 4. Service at the hotel was at best 2-3stars. No smiles, unattentive, not sure if it was them being rude or just a cultural thing. 5. We chose this hotel because of its picture of the rooftop bar on tripadvisor. We tried to visit it, it was closed for the season.

Great value to be on Adriatic Coast;4;13.05.2015;My room was overlooking the Adriatic, just steps from the hotel. I had my own private balcony and nicely appointed room at a very reasonable price. In terms of location...it cannot be any better. The hotel is immaculate, with a very nice dining area and helpful staff. The only minor thing I noticed is that the walls are very thin on the seaside of the hotel. But it didn't realty bother me as neither room next to me were noisy late at night. Although that could bother somebody if your unlucky enough to be near a noisy group. That's really the only reason why I wouldn't give it 5 stars. I still liked it a lot and would no doubt stay there again without any hesitation.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Final stop on European visit;5;29.04.2015;We spent the final couple of days of a month-long European visit at the Hotel Piran. It was the perfect end to a wonderful month. Piran is a very compact gem on Slovenia's miniscule Adriatic coast, and the Hotel Piran met our expectations in every way. It is located on the southwesterly side of the peninsula, so it gets direct sunlight most of the day. Our room faced the sea and we had an unobstructed panoramic view of the water from our balcony. The room was compact, but large enough for the two of us to be comfortable. It did not lack for any amenities. Our weather was perfect, so we made good use of the balcony when we were not out walking around the town. The hotel staff was friendly and spoke good English. We were fortunate not to have had a car, because parking is extremely limited. We arrived from Ljubljana by GoOpti shuttle bus (we highly recommend GoOpti), which dropped us off at the main square in Piran, probably less than 100 meters from the hotel. The hotel staff drove us to the bus terminal (a kilometer or less) upon our departure. We would not hesitate to stay at Hotel Piran again or to recommend it to our friends.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Great hospitality in great location;5;16.04.2015;We stayed for 3 nights recently and had an excellent stay. You must take a sea view room preferably above ground floor, anything else will leave you disappointed that you didn't spend a little more. Most rooms have a balcony. Front desk service is excellent and English is spoken perfectly. Any requests we had were dealt with immediately. As others have remarked, you cannot park your car in Piran but have to leave it in a secure garage about 800m away and take the free shuttle bus into the town where the drop off point is 2 mins from the Hotel. The hotel does run a free shuttle bus to take you and luggage back to your car..and I mean into the garage and directly to your car...great help!Breakfasts adequate and it did get rather busy on the Saturday morning. If the weather is decent then breakfast on the dining room terrace is a good option.Would easily make our list of hotels to return to.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Bit of Posh in Pretty Piran;4;14.04.2015;I did not stay as a hotel guest - only for lunch.I'm a thrifty traveller so I would not ordinarily choose somewhere on the harbour front, but as my sister and friend were visiting we decided to treat ourselves and have a girlie lunch in the outside cafe.We chose from the Brunch Menu which is good value for money, and has a varied selection. It was actually past brunch time, but the waiter let us order from the menu anyway. I chose Sea Bass salad and the girls both had the Beef salad. The food was good, the waiter was really good, and did not mind taking pictures of us.The location is lovely - directly on the harbour front. The table linen and crockery are as you would expect from a proper restaurant. I had a little look inside and the main restaurant looked inviting for an evening out. The bathrooms were spotless.I can highly recommend the Champagne Cocktails - a specialty of the establishment, and reasonably priced. All in all - not as good as Gust in Izola - but probably the best in Piran.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Piran - best choice;5;9.04.2015;Piran as a small town at the gate of Adriatic See is always a perfect choice if you want to spend a few days in total relax and with an amazing view to the rocky coastline. Absolutly the best choice! This was the first time we stopped at Hotel Piran, unfortunately just one night. The stuff was very friendly and helpful, our room was clean and well-furnished, and the breakfast was bellyful. Hotel Piran is located close to small restaurants where we had a beautiful late-dinner as we always do. We are going to come back in the summertime to enjoy the see-bathing, too!;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Comfortable, great location, good breakfast!;4;7.04.2015;"Stayed here a bit off-season, but we can imagine the restaurant might be a little crowded at breakfast during peak season(?).Very good reception, the women and men who worked there spoke several languages, informed us about everything including the somewhat tricky situation with a car-free environment, free buses and special prices at the car-garage.The windows in our attic-room were a bit small and you had to lie down on the floor to be able to look out from them, but once on the floor, the view was spectacular ;-)We would definitely stay there again!";Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Picture postcard Piran;5;28.03.2015;It would be very easy for Hotel Piran to offer 'acceptable' levels of hospitality given the majestic location it commands in such a beautiful town. Yet my experience was of an establishment aware of how fortunate it is, yet constantly seeking to provide an outstanding experience for it's guests. Most gratifying was the fact the staff always seemed to be keen to seek advice on ways they could improve the service and facilities, with a genuineness that was refreshing. Our harbour facing room was a delight to behold. Rarely am I one to linger long in my room, but the balcony view grasped my attention and wouldn't let go. You simply must seek out a sea-facing room if given the opportunity. Breakfast is served in an annexe with views out to the Adriatic, and our evening meal was of the highest standard. We were given a masterclass in Slovenian wines, which I always knew were under-appreciated globally, I just hadn't realised how much!If this hotel was situated across the other side of the Adriatic in Venice, it would demand prices three times the rate - yet Piran is arguably as enticing a venue and with none of the pomp and circumstance. I am already planning a return visit as the surroundings capture the imagination and senses.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Beautiful hotel;5;10.03.2015;It isn't the first time I stay at Hotel Piran, I even went there before it was renewed and already enjoyed it at the time. Now the experience is even greater. The location is perfect, with a great terrace directly on the sea. The rooms are great, especially if you can affoard the ones with a balcony with a view on the sea. I'd say that the attic rooms are fine for one night. Breakfast is delicious, and the staff very friendly and helpful.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Great hotel with the worst wifi!;4;13.02.2015;Great hotel. I went in winter so got quite a good deal with breakfast included and a fairly good price for a large room facing the ocean.The breakfast is massive. The waiter brings over plates and plates of food while you sit there in awe and then attempt to eat for the entire day...amazing!The room was nice, afternoon sun (I assume it would be a little annoying in summer, but was wonderful in winter!), and quite warm, comfortable and quiet.The big problem I had with the hotel was the shoddy WiFi. It was the worst I had experienced in several years. Instead of having a password or something similar, it was a free WiFi where one had to log in repeatedly during the same session. I ended up going to the café next door and using theirs after I wasted an hour one morning just trying to do simple tasks. A massive let down in quite a nice hotel.Once I stopped using the WiFi though I relaxed and enjoyed my stay immensely!;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Amazing view;5;10.02.2015;If you visit Piran, you must stay in gorgeous hotel Piran. The hotel is located next to the sea and the rooms are big and comfortable. The staff is nice and helpful and the breakfast service is quite good. I would recommende that you pay extra for room with sea view. It is worth it.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Just wonderful;5;13.01.2015;"The location is really amazing - on one side sea waves are almost hitting the walls of the hotel and on the other side the magic of this amazing historic city begins at your doorstep. The sea view is is absolutely fabulous - also the position of the hotel enables you to enjoy sunset from the room. All great restaurants are in the radius of 2 - 10 minutes walk. What else to do besides beach and food... well, a nice option is an easy walk of about 15 minutes to the church and the castle walls, or simply along the beach, and definitely you have to try to get lost in mysterious narrow streets of Piran in the night ;)Rooms have very tasty furniture and decorations and are very clean, hotel is peaceful and breakfast offers enough varieties to make you happy and it can surprise you even. We got an upgrade of the room because we visited in low season, in addition to that we got some wonderful sunny days in December and we were even able to enjoy on the terrace. Did not have time to try the new wellness, but we thought that is a great option.This whole city is pedestrian zone and all visitors leave cars in the garage outside of the city. As a guest of this hotel, you can drive with your car and they will take care of your car. Very comfortable.";Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

The service is perfect (in Both hotels I have been), The parking possibilities are quite perfect (parking house Fornaèe), an the internal bus - round trip on 15 min. intervals :-, maybe Hotels shuttle)- The architecture of the Piran is still \""original\"" in comparison with Portorož - where a flood of a\""plastic kiosk from the \""Balkan\"" are present and the waitress from Chech republic is serving you - with a knowledge of any foreign language - not even in Slovenian...

Unbeatable location, but loud overlooking the street;4;10.01.2015;Hotel Piran is located on the west side of Piran and is situated right on the Adriatic Sea. Its location is probably its best asset. You can eat breakfast while looking out over the water and Croatia and have drinks in the evening while watching the sun set and people fish along the breakwater. As a small town, Hotel Piran is convenient to all the sights and restaurants. If you are renting a car make sure to park in the lot before entering Piran and take the city shuttle or the hotel shuttle. The hotel offers reduced rates for the parking garage so make sure to ask before checking out. The city shuttle drops off at the main square and the hotel is about a five minute walk towards the water. Accommodations were nice, except make sure to ask for a room that is higher than the first or second floor if you are facing the street. In September/October there was quite a bit of street traffic into the night. Breakfast is your standard continental offerings with a selection of meats/cheeses, pastries, coffee, and juices. The room was very spacious and could fit two people plus all luggage comfortably. The bathroom was also large size, which was nice to see after visiting Bled. I would recommend Hotel Piran if visiting again, except I would definitely request a room not facing the street. When visiting Piran, make sure to eat at Neptun and Gostilna Park. Both have fabulous seafood dishes.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Beautiful Location;5;12.11.2014;Hotel Piran is placed right by the sea and the views are breathtaking.The staff were all very helpful and spoke good English.We hired a car at the airport and drove down to the coast. Once at Piran we drove to the hotel. You can't park in Piran as parking is at a premium and only residents have spaces. The hotel has a garage on the edge of town.You follow their driver to the garage and then bring you back. Parking is €7 a day.We had the attic room which may sound small but it really is deceiving it is large with a double bed and a sofa bed. It has quirky port holes as windows which give it a lot of character. You may be in the roof but there is a lift. Once out of the lift there are few steps to the room but nothing difficult to tackle.Piran is a beautiful location for a holiday and the hotel makes the experience complete.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Nice hotel;4;11.11.2014;Our stay here was very short, nevertheless we found a nice hotel suitably placed in front of the sea and next to the main square. The room was clean and spacious, unexpected for a room located at the last corner of the building. Lots of restaurants nearby.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Average;3;8.11.2014;Room was adequate, nothing outstanding like what many reviewers had stated (probably because we went for the most basic double room option). Beware, the double rooms are not suitable for the mobility impaired as one still has to climb up 5-6 steps of stairs to access it from each of the floor. ( was quite a pain for us to haul the luggage up the stairs! ) We went in the off season (November) but the weather was still sunny and decent (14c ) There was no mention of the closure on the roof top terrace on the hotel website. Hence, was extremely disappointed to find out that the bar and roof terrace (the one shown on the hotel website) that has a gorgeous view of Piran only opens between June - September! The access door to the roof terrace is locked which means one can't even go out there for a view! This roof terrace was probably the main reason why I had chosen this hotel over some of slightly cheaper options. If I were to visit the Slovenian Adriatic region again, I would consider using Isola as my base and make day trips to Piran instead. (20 min bus ride between Isola and Piran) and Isola is much less touristy!;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Great location, Poor service;2;11.10.2014;"Just inside the picturesque old town of Piran, this hotel is in a perfect location on the sea. Rooftop bar has spectacular view and nice evening ambience. Rooms are comfortable, and it's worth paying extra for a sea view (although balconies are so small that only 1 person can fit on them). Bars and restaurants on sea front make for late night noise which can often occur well after midnight. Breakfast buffet is fantastic; wide array of fruits, cereal, eggs, pastries, juice, tea/coffee. Walking distance from bus station. Now for the bad part. Hotel advertises that it has air conditioning, and the hot weather we experienced made it necessary. However the A/C never worked during our 2 night stay. We complained several times and were given many different stories (yes, our mechanic is working on it. It's only happening on your floor. It's only happening in your room. We fixed your air conditioning.). We talked to several other guests. None of them had A/C that worked. Rooms were hot and muggy, making it difficult to sleep. We opened the door to the balcony at night, but the noise from the bars below kept us up. When we checked out, I mentioned again that the A/C never worked, and the guy at the desk told me that it did work. Maybe he needs to spend a night in his hot muggy hotel before he brags about working A/C. After some insistence, the manager gave us a 20% discount. I would not stay here again.";Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Customer Service Is Outstanding;5;2.10.2014;I booked this hotel through Booking.com which was a first time for me. We were traveling with 4 other people. Our room was not quite up to the same standard as the others so I requested an upgrade ( which I was fully willing to pay). The next day we were upgraded to the Presidential Suite which was beautiful. I am sure we did not pay full price for this room even with the upgrade cost. We were treated with such great service throughout the whole experience. Our waiter Shasho was amazing. He engaged with us, but kept his professionalism in check. If you plan to go to Piran, I would highly reccomend this hotel.

Equal to Venice!!;4;29.09.2014;The location of this Hotel is excellent if you have a sea view however if you don't mange to secure one of these rooms your view is of the road side and a little disappointing. Pay the premium if you can afford to...is is definitely worth it. We watched an early morning electrical storm over the sea from our balcony and it was something else. Breakfast has the usual options ,monthlong too exciting BUT with the opportunity to sit right on the waters edge it is a wonderful way to start the day. The staff are helpful and very professional. There are limited facilities at the hotel for a four star but the location more than makes up for this. Piran itself is unspoilt due to limiting access to car traffic and it is well worst visiting...this Hotel is a perfect choice for exploring it.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Best situation;4;26.09.2014;Not luxe, but the best on the coast for being right on the Adriatic in front of the town of Piran full of good restaurants selling fresh fish and local wine. Very friendly staff. Car parking - you go through a barrier to the hotel and they take it away to park. Keeps the town fairly traffic free and much nicer to be in.

A taste of Italy in Slovenia;4;22.09.2014;I have been in this hotel twice (oct. 2007 and sept. 2014). Both periods are excellent to visit Piran. The hotel is located in the heart of old Piran, on the sea shore (a public promenade separates the hotel from the sea). Our room was comfortable and clean but the air conditionning system could not cool the room properly during the day and even at night.As we were driving, we had to park in a 3 level parking area, at the entrance of the city (7 euros / day). The hotel offers a shuttle service.Breakfast is excellent. The best recommended restaurant for dinner in this area is Neptune.

Beautiful sea view;5;22.09.2014;Everything was top notch. We did stay only for one day, so maybe I'm not the best person to review. But for that one day everything was perfect. We had a room with the sea view and it was absolutely lovely. You can go swimming in the sea right behind the hotel, so that was very convenient too. We stayed with our two small children in the same room. Unfortunately there was not enough room for two extra beds, so we got one cot bed for our baby, and our toddler slept with us in the big bed. The bed was big enough for the three of us, so no problem there either.

A bit disappointing;3;22.09.2014;"We decided to spend a night at the Hotel Piran after spending a couple of nights at two other hotels just ten minutes down the coast. Our previous hotels (Barbara Fiesa and Fiesa) had been a bit more budget conscious and a walk (albeit pleasant one) from the centre of Piran so we decided to spend a night in the town itself.The Piran is in a very imposing spot directly on the promenade. Non-permit holders are not allowed to have their cars in Piran but you are allocated an hour in which to drive to the hotel and drop your luggage off. Once checked in, the hotel offers a complimentary bus service that follows you to the carpark just out of town, waits whilst you park up and then ferries you back to the hotel. On checking out the same bus takes you right back to your parked car with your luggage. The hotel has a special rate of €7.50 per day.Check-in was smooth and friendly, as was the guy driving the minibus back and forth to the carpark.Our room was a seaview room but what we hadn’t bargained for was that it was at street level with the promenade literally the other side of your balcony. Metal railings separating you from the walkway and the balcony made you feel as if you were in some kind of metal cage. When we sat out after dinner that evening, it was noisy with people sitting on the seawall chatting. To be honest, we might just as well had a cheaper room without a balcony and sat on the seawall ourselves.We specifically booked the room not only for a view but to have air conditioning – this was not working on arrival and did not work for the duration of our stay. We were told the whole hotel was affected but the main areas seemed to be fine. We weren’t offered any kind of reduction in the rate for this – we should have probably complained but to be honest, it just isn’t our style – but it was very disappointing.Apart from that, the room itself was clean and a decent size, as was the bathroom. Had the balcony been a floor up instead of street level, it would have been very nice.The terrace bar is beautiful – we had sundowners up there and the view is stunning. It is totally roofless so only opens when the weather is good. It is worth a visit whether you are staying at the hotel or not though the cocktails seemed to be quite a bit more expensive than in the main bar downstairs but it is definitely worth a visit.The breakfast included in the room rate was fine, there was something to suit everybody.The staff all seemed friendly and efficient though it seemed odd that we weren’t asked if everything was ok with our stay when we checked out.I've given a \three\"" rating, however had we had a room off street level with aircon that worked, I probably would have given a \""four\"" - it was just disappointing to have booked something a bit more special for our last night in Piran and to have been let down by the room/aircon.""";Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Very Good;4;22.09.2014;Great service at this hotel, which is also in a fantastic location. Dagmar on reception is an absolute gem - always smiling and helpful.

seaside pleasures;4;17.09.2014;This hotel offered us a splendid room with seaviews and a terrace. We enjoyed our breakfasts, a wide range of delicious food to choose from as well as capuccinos from the bar machine, taken at our leisure on the hotel's terrace looking out to sea. We had drinks in the hotel bar which seemed overpriced, but as we were in walking distance of many restaurants and bars alternatives were not hard to find.

A very comfortable small hotel;4;15.09.2014;There is not a lot of choice for hotels in Piran and for more in hotel action if this is your thing, you might consider Portoroz which is near by. Piran is very small and therefore is a place to relax rather than seek an exciting stay.The Piran hotel accommodates this idea, it is small and comfortable with a good restaurant and a roof top bar that unfortunately was not open due to the weather while we were there. The breakfast is very good and will meet most people's expectations.Sited right on the sea wall there is the opportunity for the hardy swimmers that like a dip.

Hotel Piran;5;15.09.2014;Although we arrived in the rain we were meet with sunshine in hotel reception, the staff were so welcoming, after an easy check in we were advised the shuttle to the car park wasn't immediately available so they offered to park the car for us. As we were only staying one night we opted for a city view room, it was a good size, very clean and comfortable. The hotel is perfectly located for drinks / breakfast over looking the sea, and exploring Piran. One comment was there wasn't a swimming pool, but who needs one with the calm med right in front of the hotel with swimming access! We had drinks and breakfast at the hotel - for which there was good choice.

Staying in lovely hotel by te Adriatic Sea;5;15.09.2014;My friends and I just spent 3 nights and 4 days at the lovely Hotel Piran in Piran, Slovenia. The setting is spectacular. The pedestrian city is wonderful. The service at the hotel was superb.

Very good but could be excellent;4;5.09.2014;Excellent location in a really nice fishing port, the hotel it self was very good but could be so much better it was let down by the following 1 No coffee or tea making facilities in the room 2 room hade a longer but the sofa just pointed towards a blank wall, would have expected a TV to be on that wall, so had to watch TV from the bed, 3 the toilet was to close to the wall so could only sit on the toilet on the askew, 4 all the towels sere on the small size, no big fluffy bath towel, 5 breakfast was only average coffee was far too strong. This sounds all rather negative but we did enjoy are stay at the hotel, the staff were really friendly and helpful, and the evening dinner was excellent, the rack of lamb was out of this world.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Wonderful location!;4;2.09.2014;The best thing is the location, just in front of the sea! The breakfast is very good and complete and you can also enjoy wonderful sea views. The staff is also quite nice and helpful.The rooms are just ok, first you are a little disappointed as there are nothing special compare to the rest of the hotel. We didn't have the chance to get a sea view room so ours was in a very narrow and dark street.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Very nice and comfortable - ideally located by the Adriatic;4;1.09.2014;We stayed 4 nights at the end of our round trip of Slovenia this summer and enjoyed the discreet elegance of the hotel and its restaurant. It could hardly not be any closer to the sea...or else you need to board a boat! We enjoyed some extraordinary sun sets from our balcony and sipping our cocktails on the restaurant's terrasse.The staff is discreet and efficient, providing useful tips on Piran - a charming minute harbor which is well worth discovering.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Great;5;1.09.2014;We stayed only one night in Piran Hotel but everything was almost perfect. It is a beautiful hotel in a perfect location. We had a great room ( Grand Suite) with amazing sea view. Staff was very friendly, helpful and professional. The bar on the roof is cool and has a superb view too. Less good sides are: an avarage breakfast but did not try restaurant. Concrete beach had not an appealing look too. Will still highly recommend that hotel to everyone.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Great Hotel - Amazing Service - Perfect Location;5;27.08.2014;"We arrived at Hotel Piran just after 6pm to be told directly by the hotel staff that our room was not ready because the previous guest had failed to check out. He immediately apologised and offered two alternative solutions, including an offer of complimentary drinks while we waited for the room to be made ready. Due to the error, the hotel staff also took care of our vehicle parking, because of the unique nature of Piran.Customer Service is a key element of the hotel. It cannot be understated how quickly the staff were to deal with any issue and compensate you on the spot. It appeared like all staff had been empowered to manage you without referring to anyone else, a powerful tool in hospitality. There was only one staff member out of the entire lot that was a bit grumpy and rude, we put that off to waking up on the wrong side of the bed, and we only encountered him once at breakfast, so we don't know whether he was always that way.The inside and outside design of the hotel is unique and charming. The rooms were relatively modern but in the need of a fresh paint. Our room, a Grand Suite with Sea View, suffered a bit of water damage staining on the walls. Unfortunately, for the room also only had an old fashioned air conditioner in the one room so when we closed the door between the rooms, the main bedroom had no air conditioning.The bathroom was large, clean and apart from a floor flooding incident when the water came out the drain when we emptied the bath, we can't complain. The odd thing was having the toilet in the other room but we coped.The roof top terrace is definitely a place to enjoy the sunset and had we known it was there, we would have enjoyed it from there, but also enjoyed the outward facing benches the hotel has set up on the water front.While the \beach area\"" is more a concrete wall, the kids had an absolute ball swimming and jumping in while we sat back and relaxed.After walking past all the restaurants, we decided to eat back at Hotel Piran. While there was no kids menu, the staff and kitchen were quick to act on whipping up some fantastic pasta and grilled chicken. The rest of the meals and the wine suggestion were also all great. At the end of the dinner, we commented that in our opinion the three langoustine (scampi) dishes were slightly undercooked for our liking, making it hard to get the meat out. Without hesitating, we were immediately offered a choice of replacement dishes or to have them taken off the bill. Being half the dishes we had, we said we were happy to pay for them, especially as we had still persevered through and eaten every morsel. So we were offered complimentary drinks to enjoy the next day.The staff were by far the best part of the stay - they were absolutely fantastic and as world travellers, I find this one of the most important things. They exceed expectations of five start hotels. The restaurant was great. The rooms are on par with a four star hotel and we can't make any true complaint.Simply, we will be back to Piran and when we do come back, we will stay at Hotel Piran!!!""";Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Great location;4;25.08.2014;Recently stayed here for a night. Had a ground floor room which was ok - would have been nicer to have something higher up in the building. Nice sunset though.

Excellent, but...;4;25.08.2014;"A strange smell was in the room. During the night, i have founded, that an ammonia smell is spreading from the bathroom. I have to splash all the outlets with a plenty amount of the water, after that, the air in the room was acceptable - with open windows (Maybe the bad weather was the reason?). This was the only-one unpleasant experience, all other was excellent. Location is fantastic, the hotel shuttle to and from the parking house \Fornaèe\"". The room was comfortable, clean, maybe the bed is to hard...Breakfast was fantastic, also the personal is very friendly and polite :-). So if I take out the unpleasant odor from the bathroom.... all other was excellent.""";Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Excellent Hotel;5;24.08.2014;We visited Piran many times before, but we never spent the night so we decided to splash out a bit and book a room in hotel Piran. We parked in the parking house outside of Piran because the city is closed to car traffic to everyone but the locals. We called the Hotel and they came to pick us up (you can also walk cca 1.5 km from the garage or take a FREE bus that takes you into the town) within minutes (Hotel covers part of the daily parking fee). Hotel Piran is situated in the middle of the town and right next to the sea. Staff was very friendly and helpful and provided us with good tips about the restaurants in the area. Room was beautiful, furnished in classic style with everything you need (including a safe). Same goes for the nice and cosy bathroom. I suggest you try a hotel restaurant which for a decent price serves delicious food, either sea food or something more conventional, as well as providing a very good selection of wines. Lounge at the top floor offers a great view of the entire bay. The best part is that the sea is literally 5 meters from the hotel and you can go for a quick swim. Staff will even book a deck chair for you and give you a towel, so all you need is to enjoy. To sum it up, it is a great hotel with an excellent location and extremely relaxing atmosphere, providing an unforgettable experience. Both thumbs up!;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Location is main selling point;3;24.08.2014;"We stayed here 2 nights recently, booking through 3rd party site. Cost for \superior\"" room with sea views was approx. L140 per night. The room did have sea views but lacked a balcony, being in what appears to be the older part of the hotel above the bar/restaurant. The rooms in the newer part are the ones with the balconies. The upside of this was that being in an end room (228) the room was a good size and also had views looking towards the church on the end of the promontory. That said, whoever designed the room had clearly not given it much thought. The bathroom was tiny (and I mean tiny - just enough room to squeeze in a toilet, small sink, + shower cubicle). In addition, my partner (strangely for a woman) wished to curl (or something like that - it might have been straighten) her hair. For this she required a mirror. The only mirror (besides the one in the bathroom) was right next to the door. There was no electric point within 5-6 metres and as we don't usually travel with an extension lead we had to request an additional mirror or extension (which was duly provided). Most of the space in the room was simply wasted as there wasn't even a table & chairs for us to use, & which would have been nice in light of the lack of balcony.Breakfast is fine (selection of hot & cold), which can be taken on the tables outside looking onto the sea. Staff are very courteous & helpful.Sun loungers cost 5 euros for the whole day, which is decent value but the \""beach\"" is open to anyone (even though the loungers are organised by the hotel) & can get rather crowded in the afternoon with people squeezing their towels into any available space.Piran itself is a lovely small town & well worth a short visit.""";Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
perfect location, great service, beautiful hotel;5;23.08.2014;In our two weeks traveling through Italy and Slovenia, Hotel Piran was one of our favorite accommodations. It's ideally located right on the Adriatic and in the center of town. Guests can take in the view immediately upon entering the lobby. The hotel provides tables and lounge chairs along the water, and my fiance and I spent a good chunk of our stay either in the beautiful water or reading alongside it...Some other great features of the hotel: 1) Great rooms, even if you don't have a sea view!, 2) VERY cheap bike rental, as well as staff informative about bike paths - we biked for hours along the coast, through Portoroz and past the Croatian border. It was beautiful! 2) A complimentary parking service. Cars are not allowed to park in Piran, so after dropping off our luggage at the hotel with our rental car, a driver from the hotel drove the car to a lot right outside town (parking is not free, but cheap). A free shuttle then brought us to our car after checkout. So convenient! It's also nice to be free of the car - Piran is 100% walkable.In addition, the hotel has an incredible rooftop bar that boasts the most insanely gorgeous sunset views of the Adriatic and of all of Piran. We stood/sat/drank in awe. Also, the mojitos - though expensive - are absolutely delicious. The breakfast is also delicious and plentiful, and eating outside along the water was just perfect.Wish we could have stayed longer, and can't wait to return! Wouldn't think to stay anywhere else in Piran!;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
August stay at Piran hotel;4;21.08.2014;Really enjoyed staying at PIran hotel. Excellent location in a beautiful place. Try to get a room with a sea view.

This was my second visit to this hotel and for sure I will make it my tradiciton to run away for a few days on my own and just relax and enjoy the view and the stay. In the restaurant the food is really tasty and the beach is right in front of the hotel and they can bring you drinks there :) They also have a transport from the hotel to the garage and they help you with your laguage and everything else you might need.

Great location, reasonably priced, excellent service;5;12.08.2014;We really enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Piran this July. Ask for an ocean front room, ideally a suite, so you get a room with a larger balcony. We found the room large, well appointed, the bed for our son comfortable, and everything clean and well appointed. Breakfast was extremely generous - so many options! And the best is the location right at the water, you can walk down onto the pier in your bathing suit, jump in, enjoy the time right there at the water, and walk back up to your room for your private ocean view suite.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Fantastic location!;4;10.08.2014;We spend 3 days at Hotel Piran. It was a very good place to relax during our roadtrip in Slovenia. Overall the hotel was just perfect - staff was very friendly and helpful and location was fantastic. We were a bit disappointed with our room - we had booked a superior room with old town view. The view was poor, we could only see a little of parking place. Even though the room was quite big, I wouldn't think it was superior. One night we decided to go and have a drink at cocktail lounge at roof terrace which was a big disappointment. really expensive drinks and when I asked for the cocktail of the week, there was none. So we decided to test margaritas which had so much alcohol that you could barely taste anything else, never tasted a margarita like this before. Breakfast was ok, nothing special but still good. From a 4-star-hotel I would still expect some changes in the food, it was a bit boring to see all the same things every day at breakfast. All in all the hotel was perfect and we enjoyed staying there very much. The staff was so great that they made our visit very comfortable. It was also wonderful to swim in the sea every day. We didn't even bother to reserve sunbeds because there was usually enough space to lie elsewhere.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Very Good;4;9.08.2014;Would have given this a 9 out of 10 as this is a great hotel. the location is great- right in the heart of the action in Piran and on the sea front. I wouldn't call the sea front a beach- more a concrete jetty but this was still the best place to swim in town. We slept well, the room was comfortable with a good matress and great ac. We were in the cheaper, non sea front view with no balcony. Despite this, we had a really nice view of the church and roof tops of the town. I only saw one person using their balcony on the sea front all week- maybe they were too hot or noisy?The room was kept very clean for a hotel- absolutely spotless but strangely lacked enough wardrobe space, which meant thw two of us couldn't unload our suitcases properly and overall the rooms were a bit cramped. Breakfast was one of the best I'v ever experienced with an excellent range of cooked and cold meats/cheeses on offer. The half board meals were nice but with a limited range of choices although the service at all imes was superb. I think most guests eat in the many restaurants on the sea front so we were unusual opting for this.Overall, despite a few moans about the room- I'd definitely return here if I was ever back in Piran.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Brilliant staff and atmosphere;5;8.08.2014;My girlfriend and I just spent three great days staying at the Hotel Piran. The staff are uniformally impressive -- efficient, helpful and genuinely friendly. Everyone who works here seems to take pleasure in doing so, and to feel a real sense ofownership about the hotel. We felt very much at home. The location is perfect, right on the sea. The restaurant has a good size terrace by the water with plenty of shade and where we never had any trouble finding a table. I recommend the cocktails. Also we were impressed by the breakfast, having read some negative reviews. They have fried eggs, which is always a winner.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Great seaside view. Very nice interior.;4;5.08.2014;Good:Lovely hotel at a real premium location with an amazing view over the sea. The hotel is located immediately next to the sea and has a superb terras. The view of the balcony of the seaside rooms is simply wonderful. The breakfast was varied with a daily offer of fresh fruit. At the restaurant one can eat excellent dishes at a reasonable price given the great location. The personnel was friendly and helpful at all times. There is a convenient hotel bus service from and back to the parking house outside the Piran Village.To improve:The coffee at breakfast was from a self-service machine which did not taste that well. The coffee one can order separately is tasting great though. There are no badrobes in the rooms which would be justified given the relative high price of the rooms. When planning a tour with your car do not forget to ask the reception desk your special ticket for the Piran parking house because I was not told. Not knowing this, I paid the parking house myself for the 3 days which was quite expensive, certainly knowing that the hotel normally supports this cost.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Our room overlooked the sea and the views from the balcony were spectacular - especially the amazing sunsets. The staff were polite and helpful, check in and out were efficient and the transfers to the car park were well organised (you are allowed to drive to the hotel to unload your luggage). All the food we ate was excellent (breakfast and brunch) but the coffee and fruit juices were not great and the hotel could do with investing in better quality drink machines. Piran is a lovely, old town with lots to see and plenty of good restaurants (our favourite was Pirat, by the marina, - excellent, fresh fish platter). We hired city bikes (no gears) from the hotel to cycle along the seafront to Porteroz and on to the salt pans and the border with Croatia and we travelled by bus to Izola.

Best boutique hotel on the Slovenian coast;5;3.08.2014;I stayed at Hotel Piran for a long weekend during my trip to Italy and Slovenia. The hotel is approx 1 1/2 hours from Venice, so it's a great getaway when traveling in the area. Staff is wonderful. Everyone spoke perfect English. Accommodating to your every need, very personalized service. Rooms are wonderful. Nice size even for American standards. Very clean and modern. Ours had a large balcony over looking the Adriatic. Views were amazing! The breakfast is wonderful. Great coffee, hot and cold breakfast available, great pastries. Roof Deck: This is one of the best things about Hotel Piran. Roof deck is gorgeous with beautiful views of the sunset. Great place for an after dinner drink, good music. The town is quaint and beautiful. There are plenty of restaurants, bars, entertainment in the area. We took the hotel scooters over to Portorose(10min ride) when we wanted to do some shopping or get ice cream(Cacao is the best place). I have stayed at the Kempinski palace in the past and although I absolutely loved it, it is now my 2nd choice hotel in the area. Hotel Piran really impressed me with their personalized service.

Amazing views - definitely worth the extra L for a sea view room;4;30.07.2014;Stayed for 4 nights. Lovely room (although not that large). Views from balcony were spectacular. Parking at the multi-storey is absolutely fine - just a bit confusing when first arrive! Make your way down to the very bottom of the car park and then follow sign to the free shuttle bus nearer the sea. Alternatively you can phone the hotel and they will come and collect you from inside the car park. Breakfast is excellent, if a little hectic. Smoked salmon was lovely! Coffee and juices were a bit watered down. You have to pay extra for sun loungers and parasols and you need to get in early in the morning to get these! Also, it isnt a private area so other people (not from the hotel or could be from the hotel) can then pitch up in front of you with their own sun lounger etc. Did not look very restful. We didnt bother with this - better to walk around to the shingle beach round the point. Went on day trip to Trieste - drove - easy to find. Also, used Trieste Lines and took day trip by boat to Rovinj in Croatia. Would recommend doing both. Boat departs from the jetty at Piran - however, ensure you have bought your tickets the day before - there are a couple of places in Piran where you can buy them from. However, reception at the hotel did not explain this to us - they told us to turn up. Fortunately there was enough room on the boat but we were told that we should have bought the tickets in advance! Remember your passports! Remember to save a day to look around Piran and perhaps walk to Portoroz (or could catch the mini train/bus).;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Still the place to stay;4;29.07.2014;We have been coming to Piran for many years and Hotel Piran is always our first choice. Its location is excellent. Piran is a beautiful place to visit and anyone looking for a quick escape from Ljubljana for a day or two should consider Piran. Its renovation has been tastefully done. The only thing to remember is that cars are not allowed in Piran unless you are a resident. You can park outside of Piran in the multi storey car park (park on the lower levels as that's where the hotel shuttle or local free bus will pick you up).;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Very nice place;5;29.07.2014;Nothing to say! Everything is perfect!Try one of those small restaurants for the fresh fish and sea food. Just couple of steps into the city.

A stunning location;5;28.07.2014;We arrived here in wonderful sunshine and the views around the hotel were stunning. Our reception by the staff was excellent and we immediately took advantage of the lovely terrace to have drinks overlooking the sea. The rooms were clean and comfortable.

Good honest clean place to explore Piran;4;28.07.2014;"Hotel Piran was a pleasure to stay at and the staff did a lot to make our one night stay pleasant. The car park is quite far away from the city but the hotel staff took care of parking the car once we arrived at the hotel and brought us to the car the next day. The only reasons I am not giving them the full points is that:(a) the room did not have a \old city view\"": it had a view of the short term parking.(b) the breakfast buffet was rather limited and good coffee had to be purchased.""";Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Great location, may be a bit noisy at night;4;26.07.2014;Location of hotel Piran is perfect - next to the beach in the city center. True, you need to park your garage outside the city, but the shuttle service works fine. Very attentive and helpful staff at front desk!!! Rooms are nice with balcony (request sea view). Rooms 7-9 on ground floor next to elevator - avoid if you can. Also, we had loud music from a nearby bar till 2am - despite closed windows...

hotel Piran a nice experience;4;26.07.2014;Hotel Piran is a four star hotel located at the water front.

Lovely hotel but beware of extra costs;3;23.07.2014;We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and overall had a great time. The location by the sea is superb, the staff are friendly and the hotel is clean and modernised tastefully. We were aware of the parking situation and the need to pay for parking outside the town centre. One very disappointing aspect though was when sitting on a sun lounger on the hotel waterfront, we were asked 'how would you like to pay for your sun lounger?' We were genuinely shocked by this situation as we have travelled extensively and have never had to pay extra for such a basic facility. After voicing our complaint to the gentleman, he arranged to reduce our charge slightly with reception, but the hotel policy is €5 per day, per chair/umbrella, regardless of how long you use it. When you add this €15 (a chair each and 1 umbrella) per day to the €7.50 per day for parking, it all starts to add up. Although these are relatively small sums of money, the principle of it starts to leave a sour taste to your visit, which is a shame. Beyond that, the breakfast is lovely and plentiful, but the coffee is poor.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Nice hotel;3;22.07.2014;Very nice staff and location, but the aircon did not work very well.. And it was too nosy to sleep with the window open. Other than that, a lovely place by the sea.

On balance - it's a yes to this hotel;4;22.07.2014;Stayed here on the last night of our hols. Didn't realise until we arrived that PIran was a car-free zone and it was a 'drop the luggage then park the car elsewhere' job. Had we known we may not have bothered (because we were in a Morgan which has 'special needs') but I am very glad we did. Piran is a delightful town and it was wonderful being at its heart. The Hotel has a fantastic position on the waterfront. Rooms are well appointed (best shower we had over the 2 week period), and the breakfast was excellent (we had dinner in one of the many restaurants along the waterfront). The receptionist was amazingly efficient. There is one thing......there is a bar next to the hotel (at the harbour end) which was pelting out loud music into the small hours on the night we stayed (which is not a problem if your windows are shut and the air con is on). And if there is a mass exodus at check-out time then some patience may be needed to get the hotel shuttle up to the car-park at the top of town. Neither are sufficient reasons to avoid this hotel, in my view, given its stunning position in a divine town which is so much nicer than Porteroz up the coast. So YES to this hotel.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Fantastic views, but bad service;3;9.07.2014;Piran is a gem, and hotel Piran has got great views and a wonderful location. However I was quite disappointed with the service. I had booked a 2 bedroom suite through booking.com with a furnished balcony with sea view . When we arrived we were told we could not check in until 6 pm for undisclosed reasons, but as a compensation we would get an upgraded room and free parking. The room that we got was far from an upgrade, the balcony was so small you could barely fit 2 chairs, it would have been totally fine if it had been described as such in the booking contract, but you honestly could not call this a furnished balcony. The view how ever was immaculate. It also turned out that all the other guests also got free parking, so it was not really a compensation. It was really annoying having to wait for the room as it was raining and we were travelling with two kids. The wifi worked sporadically. The room was otherwise very spacious and clean.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Excellent but a few points missing for a 4-star hotel;4;9.07.2014;Hotel Piran has many positive reviews for good reasons:- Its location is superb, directly facing the Adriatic Sea, and just next to the main square and all Piran’s attractions.- The hotel has been recently renovated, its design is sleek and modern.- The front staff is extremely nice and professional.- The service they provide to help you park your car is great. You can first enter the town to unload (1-hour free ticket), then drive back to the Fornace garage where you can park at a discounted price (7.5 euros per day). When the hotel shuttle is not available (it stops at level 7A), you can take the free city shuttle that runs every 15 minutes (it stops outside the garage next to a parking lot, you need to exit the parking at level 1B).However, as a 4-star hotel, I was a bit disappointed by a few things which could be easily solved: - In my single room with sea view, there was just one electrical plug for the television (and another one in the bathroom for electrical shavers), now people travel with mobile phones and laptops that need to be charged.- In-room and bathroom amenities are minimal, I would have expected tissues, slippers, a luggage rack, a small table on the balcony (just one chair was provided without cushion).- The television was a small and old 4/3 screen when all hotels have now large and modern 16/9 screens.- The breakfast buffet is great with a wide selection of fresh and tasty products, unfortunately the fruit juices (from a machine) and the coffee machines (espresso, cappuccino) are not up to the standard.- The internet did not work very well in my room located on the third floor, the wifi signal was weak, the connection speed pretty low, with frequent disconnections.Apart from the above points, Hotel Piran is highly recommended.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Great place with friendly stuff, for sea lovers;4;7.07.2014;I've been many times in Piran, but had no chance to stay here before.This time is was carefully booked :) I chose a double room with a sea view. It was located on the 3rd floor. The view was PERFECT! Room -clean. Stuff polite.Very important, when one wish to book sun beds near the sea, please do it in the evening ... there might be no spare ones .... we managed with a help of the great guy, to find two, but it was not easy. The towels are provided.Restaurant is also very good. Breakfast is quite substantial and tasty. One weak point - coffee .... We prefer good one, not instant :( we asked for an extra ... but received a medium quality .... I guess it was just a coincidence...Visit the roof top caffee, but ... attention... the prices are not low at all. There was a good suggestion - to discount prices for hotel guests :) I vote for:)One point - parking. Parking has a free shuttle bus to the city centre. Back - we had a nice transport service, offered by hotel:) It was great, as the temperature was over + 30 C.... I will definitely do my best to visit and stay here again.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Something Different;3;3.07.2014;Friendly staff, great breakfast, loved the location and even swimming from the public promenade.To us 22 50 euros per day for car park, sun loungers and umbrella (2 people) moves the hotel into a different charging category. .Our splendid balcony ,with fabulous views, was spoilt by the choice of clearly inadequate spaced woodblock flooring. It was never going to work properly and hasn't . Many of the blocks had broken free and the balcony resembled a madman's game of Jenko - rip it up and start again please. The other major concern was the beautiful rooftop terrace.Top management needs to decide whether this facility is for the benefit of the guests or a Cocktail rip off joint for posers with more money than sense. Is it really the case that the prices have to be outrageous to restrict numbers so the downstairs dishwasher does not get overloaded? At those prices you can throw the glasses away and still make a profit.I have taken the trouble to highlight these things because those guests we met were genuine people who appreciated the ambience of the Hotel and surroundings . It succeeds but with the  Hotel lacking in public spaces use the terrace please - why not discount all drinks on hotel bills, a sundowner with sparkling wine , a welcoming cocktail?? .At reasonable prices ( it's cheaper in 5/7star Dubai) we would have visited the terrace most evenings but as it was we made our 47th wedding anniversary special with one drink on an empty but fabulous rooftop.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Amazing service, hospitality and organization that meet guests' needs, requests and expectations. Very good buffet breakfast and a la cart options, ideal for resting and relaxing. Falling asleep just next to the sea, listening to waves breaking the shore is priceless. The dream view to the open sea and Piran's front line is not to be missed, either from your room balcony or from the lounge bar terrace on top of the building. Exceptionally helpfull, kind and professional staff, the front office management and operators one of the best if not the best which we encountered so far.

Wonderful!!;5;27.06.2014;We arrived by bus from Ljubljana and this hotel was easy to spot in the distance with great signage, it was an easy walk from where the bus stops, from there only residents are able to drive in Piran old city. The hotel is located on the water, we had a ocean view room with a balcony, certainly worth the extra cost. The service was outstanding and I wish I could remember the name of the man who is the Customer Service Manager (I think), he was brilliant, he organised for the car hire company to bring the car to the hotel and was just so helpful during our stay. He and the lady on the front desk were outstanding in customer service - just brilliant. The hotel it also wonderful, they have a restaurant which was well run with wonderful food, we did eat elsewhere in Piran, but I think the hotel was the best. We returned 3 days later after visiting Istria in Croatia and on return were upgraded to the Presidential Suite :). There is also a rooftop bar that looked great for afternoon drinks, but unfortunately we had bad weather on the last afternoon we were there and didn't get to use it. I highly recommend this hotel and will always fondly remember our time and the staff there. The only area that I think they could improve is breakfast, it was ok, but not a lot of variety. BTW one Friday afternoon there was a fabulous food market in the town square with a great variety of food - another highlight.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
A Classic Hotel that knows your name;5;27.06.2014;"The Hotel Piran is an up-to-date property that opened in 1913. It has been completely renovated.

Well priced 4 star hotel;5;24.06.2014;My partner and I stayed in the Hotel Piran for 2 nights. The staff were excellent, very friendly and helpful, nothing seemed to be a chore. The room was of a good standard with an excellent sea view however I would advice paying that little extra for a room with balcony however. In terms of value, we initially thought it a little pricey (we mainly stayed in hostels in Slovenia). However the hotel had an excellent reduction for the out of town car park and free transfers to said car park and the casino in Portoroz.The food although slightly high in price was delicious, my partner was very pleased that they did not cut themselves down to mainly serving sea food as many other restaurants in Piran do.The breakfast was a great selection of cooked and cold meats and vegetarian options. We couldn't of asked for a greater choice.Tips:Park in fornace car park, ask the carpark attendand to contact the hotel.Watch out for the very high prices of the rooftop cocktail bar.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Lovely, Charming Hotel and Town;4;24.06.2014;Piran is a cute, not-too-touristy town, and the Hotel Piran is the perfect place to stay when visiting. Located right on the water (but don't expect a sandy beach), it is the perfect place for exploring the small town. Very central location, but was quiet at night. Rooms have character and are recently renovated. The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating, which I have found to be true of Slovenians in general. Note, that there is no car parking at the hotel or in the town center, so you leave you car in a garage a 15 minute walk from the hotel.

Great location next to the sea;4;14.06.2014;The hotel is right in the centre of town and next to the promenade by the sea.Only local traffic is allowed in the town and so our private transfer vehicle dropped us off at the town entrance near to the bus station and we had to walk the rest of the way (about 10 minutes).The room was comfortable and looked towards the town but there are more expensive rooms that have great sea views.The Wi-Fi was free and worked well. The room also had a mini bar.Breakfast was sufficient but not that much choice in comparison to other four star hotels. The bonus though is that you can take it outside with stunning views of the sea.This hotel is definitely a good choice for a stay in Piran.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Great Piran hotel;4;12.06.2014;"We stayed at Hotel Piran for 3 nights (spending one lovely day on a long day-trip to Venice, and 1.5 even lovelier days exploring Piran and the nearby towns). It is a lovely, old-fashioned seaside hotel. We opted for a less expensive room without a balcony or sea view (figured we'd be out exploring most of the time anyway), and we were very satisfied. It was clean and elegant, a perfect base for exploring. Breakfast was outstanding. And the location is unbeatable. Piran is not car-friendly, largely because it is small and very walking-friendly. Hotel Piran is literally steps away from the central square, and from Piran's many wonderful restaurants. And from there, you can find lovely seaside paths on either side of Piran, to take you along the coast to Piran's neighboring towns. Hotel Piran could rest on its location alone, but it doesn't; it provides a beautiful hotel with excellent service. Highly recommended.";Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

The balcony was fabulous even though we couldn't enjoy it due to the cold weather and the bedroom was properly appointed. We were disappointed by what was described as \the living room\"". It contained a settee and TV set and was clearly intended to be used as an extra bedroom in order to accommodate a family of 4 or 2 couples. There was not even a small coffee table to put a glass on! There are carpets on the floor and a lot of curtain material which give the room a certain stuffiness which is accentuated by the choice of colours - all a bit sad to be honest.The staff in the hotel is exceptionally helpful and friendly and the hotel runs an excellent arrangement with the parking garage of the town.""";Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

magnificent;4;21.05.2014;such a lovely place just at the shore of the deep blue adriatic sea. we know the sister hotel 'hotel evropa' in celje, slovenia... and it was the right decision to choose this one. it's the only 4* hotel in the core of the ancient piran. a medieval city with big influence of the Venice serissima. we had bad luck with some rainy weather bud there are enough nice, small trattorias and restaurants with superb fresh squid, fish and meat from the grill...and very tasty espresso. don't miss to tray the nice and quite good restaurant at the hotel it self. a wide range of istrian goodies as fish, pasta wit tartuffina or delicate filet with white Tartuffe... take a superior room or a studio facing the sea. the rooms might be slightly small and you can hear tv next room...bud that's a very marginal point. the staff is very nice and helpfulle. when parking before the citygate (left hand) you'll have a discount of 50% and can order a shuttle/driver to the hotel. a great place to start strolling around the city and beaches. we'll come back!;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
A haven of peace!;5;20.05.2014;We had four nights here in May. We had done quite a bit of travelling, so needed somewhere comfortable and relaxing to do some sitting around. We were not disappointed, particularly as we booked a sea-side room with a balcony. We arrived by train and bus, so were not worried about car parking, so for us the hotel was perfectly positioned, particularly as we were leaving on the Venice ferry, and just had to walk the fifty yards or so to the dockside!From start to finish, the staff and the service were first class. I asked one of the young ladies on reception to translate a Slovenian birthday card for my wife, which she did obligingly. She obviously took note of this, as when we checked out they handed my wife a box tied with ribbon, containing some cake to celebrate her birthday! A lovely touch! Not only that, they gave us each a packed lunch because we were leaving before breakfast.Breakfast was very good, but we never tried the restaurant for an evening meal as it lacked a little atmosphere and there were several excellent sea-front restaurants a short distance away,, though we did eat an excellent lunch at the hotel one afternoon.I know they have done a lot of work on the 101-year-old hotel, but I think the rooms need some attention to bring them up to four star level. For example, a double bed should be a double, not two twins pushed together, so you can disappear down the crack in-between! Also, the moth-holes in the curtains with the light shining through in the mornings tend to bring down the quality a little. Some facility to make morning tea in one's room would also help to attract us English visitors! Just give us a kettle, two cups and a few tea bags!These minor criticisms apart, we had an excellent experience at this hotel, and absolutely loved the town of Piran, so will definitely return. Thanks to all the staff for making us feel so welcome.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Nice place, excellent staff;5;13.05.2014;We stayed two nights at the Hotel Piran on May, 2nd and 3rd. And even during these rainy days, we enjoyed it. We arrived directly with our car at the door of the hotel in the old town and we received a perfect help from the staff about luggage and parking arrangements. The sea view from the room is beautiful. By itself the room is fine, but not so much excellent as what we found in Ljubljana and which was less expensive. More than 200 euros for two per night is maybe a little bit expensive, but for sure we had no regret. This is probably the best place to stay in Piran and enjoy the town.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Three star hotel with five star staff;4;6.05.2014;The first thing which strikes you about this hotel is the courtesy and warmth of the staff. The doorman meets you as you drive up and helps with luggage and then drives with you back to the car park and organises all the parking arrangements and transfers with military precision. With the hotel discount it is also very reasonably priced. The reception staff are always smiling and checking with you that all is OK. The rooms are impeccably cleaned. Breakfast staff cope amazingly with large numbers in a tiny and completely inadequate breakfast room which doubles up as a restaurant for the rest of the day. That said, the bedrooms are very small. We had a view of the cement mixer and workers below on the promenade. This meant fumes and noise - and on one day this was quite early. There was no pre-warning of thee works on the website of the hotel or our agency - Booking com. The room - a double - has only one chair and a balcony for midgets. The bathroom is dated but serviceable but soaps and shampoos are parsimoniously dispensed - with one tiny piece of soap for two persons for two days. Breakfast is very good, except for the coffee which I found grim. The problem is just the lack of space. The hotel was nowhere near full though it was early season and too cool to sit outside. Even so I wonder how they cope on a rainy day in high season? The staff do cope - nothing runs out for long...and like the other staff they are all charming.Location right on the front is good, There are some excellent fish restaurants nearby and good views across the bay. So overall the staff save what is a rather dated hotel which is poorly appointed for breakfast and bedrooms though tiny could be better furnished (there is at least room for a second and more comfortable chair). Worth putting up with the short comings for location and the warm welcome.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Once in the restaurant i ordered desert and the waiter forgot to bring it to me, because some other guest was asking something. It was no issue I asked his volleague the same minute.. When I was paying I was told that i should not pay for the desert, because i had to ask for it twice. Cant remember such aproach from anywhere else. Our son got sick and we had to leave one day early - again it was deducted from our bill without asking. It was the aproach that made the hotel different for us.

Peaceful stay in Piran;5;2.02.2014;The hotel is located by the waters edge in the old town. To get here we caught the bus from Trieste via Koper, and the hotel is about 8-10mins walk with bags from where the bus dropped us off. The Piran old town is very very small therefore nothing is too far a walk from the hotel. All the main sights, the main square, lighthouse, shops and waterfront restaurants are all very close. Staff at reception were very friendly, welcoming and accommodating. It was extremely quiet as it was low season, didn't see anyone else in the hotel and we always had the entire restaurant to ourselves each morning for breakfast (that may be why the selection was not huge, although it was decent). The room itself was nice, large, good bathroom and shower, with a slight view of the water through the shutters that were locked closed (would be nice if they opened). Good free wifi. The only unusual thing we noticed during our stay was that in some parts of the lobby, and particularly near the lobby bathrooms there was a strong sewerage smell. I'll assume that was just a temporary hiccup that has hopefully been sorted out. Reception booked for us a taxi to Croatia which was much cheaper than quotes we got ourselves, so that was a good bonus. Definitely I would recommend staying here for a short break in Piran.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
the fourth star is for the location;4;9.01.2014;have been to Piran number of times, never in this hotel before (though we used the hotel's restaurant a lot). well, in all honesty it shall be a 3 star place - the rooms were small and a bit empty. They were not pricey, though, and one may say it was a good value to pay 140 euro for a sea-view suite per night. The breakfast was not overwhelming to say the least. interior is very modest and staff was limited, so were the quests also (it was January, the lowest season for Piran)I have to admit it was very clean also. As an allergic person, I do not like carpets and can feel an old/dirty carpet with my lungs, but in this case the carpets were either fresh or cleaned very well - did not have a slightest problem.Mattresses, on the opposite, were a bit worn out and hardened by generations of tourist bodies, so I can't give more then 3 points for sleep quality.Definitely one thing that helps is the location itself, and it is worth the money and time spent there. Another good thing was the restaurant - though they have a small variety fixed menu, they were trying to be very attentive and flexible with us - this time and before, also. During season, we used the Piran Hotel restaurant as an alternative to crowded promenade taverns - it was never crowded inside.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

It has an outdoor veranda area for refreshments or meals. It's in door dining, particularly the breakfast buffet is very good. No complaints. If you want a stay near the beach or casinos, of course you would stay in Portorož, the town adjacent to Piran (or Pirano in Italian). You can shuttle back and forth between the two, of course. There are many very good seafood restaurants along the waterfront. This small fishing town is interesting to walk around and definitely gives the flavor of old Europe. It is what we expected and we enjoyed our stay after touring much of Slovenia, from Idrija to Bled, Ljubljana and Metlika on the Croatian border. Wonderful country!

Hotel Piran;3;1.10.2013;It would be difficult to find a more perfect location to build an hotel. The small town of Piran in Slovenia is ideally located on a small peninsula jutting out into the Adriatic sea.The Hotel Piran is situated on the sea front (quite literally) and from the sea facing rooms there are spectacular views of the sea, the small harbour, Croatia and the constant traffic of yachts and fishing boats along the coast.On arrival one is greeted by very friendly and helpful front desk personnel. They are multilingual speaking Slovenian, Italian, German, English and even Russian.For the price the rooms are just adequate, not very luxurious and in need of a face lift. The area can be quite noisy at night time and even in the morning if a bus load of tourists arrive before breakfast. If you pre book a double room make sure you get a double bed and not two singles which constantly slide apart.While the front desk staff are friendly and helpful the waiters forgot to go to the same school of tourism. Given that tourism plays such a key role in this area and one can actually get a degree in tourism in Slovenia, it was quite surprising that the waiters in the bar / restaurant did not seem to have attended at customer management training. Apart from one exception, they were a surely bunch. On the first morning, a Sunday, we were greeted to an experience never seen in 40 years of business travel. The breakfast was scheduled to be served from 7-10.00. At 2 minutes before 10.00 they started clearing way what was left of the breakfast buffet. The orange juice and coffee machines were disconnected. When guests asked for coffee the waiters actually shouted at us that they were FINISHED. The only way to get a coffee was to buy one. Even ordering a drink in the evening one was left with the impression that the customer was somehow discommoding them. There was no sense of care or interest from the staff. No nuts or nibbles were served with drinks.While the hotel is beautifully located it would now seem that it is trading on a fading reputation and the owners and management need to take a serious look at their customer facing staff, front desk, excepted.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
nice hotel;4;27.09.2013;Hotel is fully renovated, good size & nice bathroom. Staff is friendly & breakfast buffet is great. Seats outside overlooking the sea, spend time there to enjoy my breakfast, watching people swimming & have a nice view for sunset while enjoying my cocktail before dinner.But the air-conditioning in the room is not cool enough,management should do something about that.Hotel is situated in a lovely town & close to the old town square.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Beautiful location but........;3;16.09.2013;This hotel is in a fabulous location provided you choose a sea view with balcony room. However, there are quite a few buts...The rooms and the facilities are at best average and the breakfast adequate. However,I seriously object to having to pay to lie on the hotel's sunbeds at the front of the hotel when I am paying 140 Euro per night in September. . Also, their advertising focuses heavily on their beautiful roof terrace which, surprise, surprise is only available by reservation at 10 euro per person. What a con!! Also, be mindful that there are no tea and coffee facilities although this does appear to be the norm across all Slovenia Hotels.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

a little piece of heaven;5;5.09.2013;We were blown away by Piran and the experience was made even more memorable by the hotel receptionist. She couldn't have been more helpful or happy, a real ambassador for the Hotel so top marks for you! Not the most luxurious hotel we've ever stayed in but the views and the surroundings made up for that. Ground floor room No.5 with its own private terrace overlooking the Adriatic couldn't have been more pleasing.

You'll love the location;4;18.08.2013;On the Plus side: You just can't think of a better location for this hotel in Piran. I loved the possibility to swim in the Adriatic a few feet away from the lobby of the hotel. Hotel Piran has a great restaurant (which our guidebook did not mention) where we had the best meal of our whole trip, and breakfast was also delicious.Somewhere between Plus and Minus: Service was very uneven. We had some of the best people, like the bus driver taking us back and forth to the parking lot who was very helpful, the manager of the front desk we met in the morning, our waiter at dinner etc. But we also had to deal with a person at the front desk who is way too laid back and incapable and does not deserve the job. More information available if necessaryTo be improved: like every other place we visited in Slovenia, the AC was a little sluggish, and this can be a problem on a hot summer day.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Fantastic Location, Fascinating Town;4;16.08.2013;Recently returned from a week here. Would certainly recommend this hotel, right on the sea in this great little town with its Venetian style buildings and Italian atmosphere. Room was comfortable and clean although more shelf/clothes storage space would have been useful. We found staff to be friendly and a problem with a loose and non working socket was sorted out quickly. Food is good and there is a terrace right by the sea which was great for eating, drinking and watching the passing scene. The waiters were particularly attentive and friendly. Piran itself is a warren of little streets and alleyways - climb the bell tower for a wonderful view over the town and the surrounding coast. Some earlier comments going back a couple of years don't seem very complimentary but I think the hotel has been refurbished and We certainly enjoyed our stay here.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Piran and its best Hotel;5;4.08.2013;“Piran and its best Hotel”Recensione in attesa Should you want to experience a magical weekend in a old Venetian Village, swim in the sea at the hotel door steps, enjoy the many restaurants nearby, forget about the car, the busy traffic, the mass tourism, well, the best bet would be to spend your long weekend in PIRAN. And the Hotel Piran is the right choice. Newly rennovated, perfectly located in the centre and practically on the shore. Service is friendly and always with a smile. Breakfast buffet complete of everything you need: hot scrambled eggs, boiled eggs, bacon, sausages, cold cuts, cheese, yogurt, granolas, fresh fruits, 5 tipes of bread, croissants, honey, marmelades, selections of teas, coffee, milk. try to get a table outside close to the sea.Piran has a car-free- traffic policy and all the village is pedestrianised.

Lovely hotel on the seafront;4;3.08.2013;We had a 10 day holiday here in July and enjoyed every minute of it. The hotel has been refurbished, and our sea view balcony room,was spacious and very clean. Its lovely to get up in the morning and look out to sea, or watch the local fitness group doing their routine. The staff were all very helpful and friendly at all times, including our waiter friend Saso. The food for breakfast and evening meal was buffet style, but the hot food wasn't topped up enough, so we mentioned this and they decided because there was so few of us eating bufftet style in the evening they would offer us a set 4 course meal of either fish or meat whchwas excellent. Piran is so beautiful, with is cobbled streets and quaint squares where little bars and restuarants are hidden away. The sea is beautiful clear and clean, but do take good beach shoes, and a mat as they are very rocky;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

Not a lot of great choice in Piran but this hotel is OK;3;23.07.2013;Hotel has just been renovated so the rooms were pretty good but the beds and pillows are very hard. There was a chemical smell in the room maybe from the new carpets and furniture. It Smelled unhealthy due to new furnishings/carpets. The air conditioning worked adequately. Our room over looked the beach area but the balconies are arranged so that people from the other rooms can see right into your room so not a lot of privacy. Our balcony was concrete so hard to see the water unless you were standing up but like I said there was no privacy in the room so we had the curtains closed and then you cant enjoy the view. The staff were helpful and even found me one soft pillow. The breakfast was just OK. Coffee not very good. This hotel is located right on the water and in the evenings there is a lot of noise. There was pounding music until 1 am. That isn't the hotels fault that is just the way it is in Piran. If you like to party this is the place for you. Internet worked OK. Parking is in a lot about 15 minute walk away but the hotel will take you there or pick you up.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

One night visit;5;11.06.2013;The hotel is totally renewed and can be found in an excellent location, beside the sea. The staff was friendly, the breakfast complies with 4 stars and can be consumed on the seaside terrace. Only the machine coffee is weak. The room was light and comfortable, the bathroom is also luxurious with even a bidet. Only negative thing is the parking, which is an adventure, better not going by car. When we were there the town was celebrating an anniversary or something, and on the hotel terrace there was live music and serving of unlimited free wines and snacks, flowers for the ladies, which made our stay excellent.

Very average hotel, only worth staying here for the view;3;11.11.2012;Like others have mentioned in their reviews of Hotel Piran the accommodation options in Piran are very limited. We booked a sea view room at this hotel because of its good location and while the view from our room was amazing the room itself left much to be desired. It was incredibly outdated, not as clean as I would have liked, and we barely slept due to a loud party going on all night on the floor above us. The staff at reception were very friendly and helpful, but the breakfast staff were rude and the breakfast itself was awful.

Loved the view;5;30.09.2012;We enjoyed our stay at Hotel Piran – location was very good, right on the water, the terrace and the view amazing, and these were the main reasons we picked this hotel. Breakfast was very good, definitely the best we had in Slovenia, and contrary to the previous reviewer’s experience, we enjoyed it a lot. There was a coffee machine where at a touch of a button you could have cappuccino, espresso, café latte, café macchiato, tea, hot chocolate, etc. No extra cost, it was included in the breakfast. It was not made to order, but self-serve, and no limit on how many you could have…We found the staff helpful and attentive. We were on the 2nd floor, and had no problem with the noise. True, it was hot and we had the a/c on (and the windows closed) most of the time. From the time we booked we knew that the hotel does not offer parking (it is situated in a pedestrian only area, after all), and that the parking was expensive (the hotel provided all this info when we booked). The shuttle to the garage was ok though, and in nice weather, it would only be a 15-20 minutes walk by the sea. We would definitely stay there again.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Very bad service, good location, bad parking;1;26.09.2012;"We chose this hotel because of it's location: directly on the waterfront promenade in the picturesque Slovenian town of Piran. The location was quite the only thing that was really great about the hotel.The staff was stressed, unhelpful and impolite. At breakfast, which was included in the room price, the \rules\"" on which coffee was for free changed daily. On the first day, I was served a real, tasty latte macchiatto without charge. On the second day, I was told that the latte is charged extra but that I can have a free cappucino. On the third day, I was told that I can have the pre-brewed coffee from a thermos for free and everything else is extra. A disaster in customer management.We also had a run-in with the management on the issue of towels. We asked for extra towels to take to the beach and were really badly treated. Our room had a great seaside view and a spacious balcony but the bathroom looked as if it was decorated in early 60s. Also, one of the walls in the room had a huge, disgusting stain, about 1m in diameter.Also the parking arrangement is horrible. We had to leave the car at a paid parking lot and we ended up paying around 50Euros for 4 days.

luxurious surprise;5;25.09.2012;Piran itself is a small town of narrow, often steep streets and buildings little changed over the centuries, with good access by bus to Capodistria and other places of interest.The Hotel Piran, though, is surprisingly spacious, and the meals (buffet-style) were excellent in both quality and choice. The view from the breakfast room, across the sea to Croatia, is breathtaking. Everything was scrupulously clean, and we haven't often been in a better hotel.Smoking is, as others have suggested, a problem (and was allowed if guests had tables outside), but that's a national issue, so it's hard to be critical there. Also, you might come across the odd drunk in the square, but they keep themselves to themselves.So, overall, the hotel was a pleasant surprise.

"Nice room; average for the price";3;30.07.2012;"We enjoyed our stay at the hotel. We were placed in the new rooms across the street from the hotel. The hotel is very conveniently located, and we enjoyed having a refreshing swim off the rocks in front of the hotel. Staff was extremely helpful. We arrived in a car, unloaded our backpacks, and then followed a driver to the car park. He directed us where to park and then took us back to the hotel. Upon checkout, he took us back to our car. Very nice service. The room was clean, cool, and quiet. Beds were large and bathrooms were big enough for us. However, this hotel is more expensive than most others, so I guess one would expect the basic services and accommodations mentioned above. We were travelling with a bit of \carpe diem\"" attitude, making reservations at the last minute or just showing up. So, this was a good find - but not a bargain. I think we would have tried to let a room at the Pri Mari.

Expensive but ok.;4;15.07.2012;We usually stay in small guesthouse or pension type places. This is a big hotel and as such just lacks that personal friendly touch we love while traveling. It is not bad or rude, just not so personal. Kind of like staying at a Hilton or Marriott. That being said, it is very pricey but it is right on the waterfront, is nice and clean, great view from patio, but can you believe for €115 no free WiFi?!?! So we had to go hang out at Danoi Bar, drink a bottle of wine and use the WiFi there. Nice, but would rather be on our patio, you know? So really, not bad, not great, you get what you see on the web site. Tomorrow we are out in the country at an agritourismo!

Great location, likeable hotel;4;11.07.2012;With an excellent seafront location in a charming old town, there is a lot to like about Hotel Piran, where we spent four very hot and pleasant days in late June. Our accommodation on the first floor came with a balcony large enough to sit out on, and overlooking the sea and the concrete platform that serves as a beach (more about beaches later).Our reservation through an online site caused a few raised eyebrows (the hotel when contacted directly had declared they were fully booked in superior seafront rooms), and as we waited for a room to be made up, there was a slight worry that the handshaking between hotels.com and the establishment itself might not be 100%. However, the very friendly receptionist came through, and our room was by all accounts among the best in the house, particularly as those on higher floors often have a rather small French balcony that is less convenient. We were not unduly troubled by late-night noise from the revellers (note: midnight swimming is popular), and the advantages of being directly overlooking the sea are quite obvious.The room itself was light and airy, with a large bathroom (a missing plug for the sink was quickly found by the cleaning staff, and the secrets of operating the in-room safe were explained to us by the same friendly receptionist - although why there were no instructions in the room escapes me). The hotel does not approve of taking towels to the beach, so it’s probably worth bringing one for a longer stay. The air-con was fully up to the task of coping with searing heat of 35C.Wi-Fi is apparently available, but we were cheerily advised by one of the front-desk staff not to bother with it, as it is chargeable and there is a very strong signal available at (and outside) a popular bar just down the promenade. People stand by the wall of the City Theatre and get their emails, or assuage their guilty conscience by doing it in the bar with a beer while they watch the sunset. Nobody seems to bat an eyelid at this.Breakfast was good, though the hot dishes tended to run out fairly quickly at peak times, but they were always replaced promptly. The hotel website refers to a panorama restaurant upstairs, but this was not in use, and breakfast was taken outside looking at the sea. The hotel also has a dining restaurant, but Piran is choc-a-bloc with seafront eateries, so I suspect many eat out. The library on the first floor is a nice touch, and the hotel generally gives off a comfortable rather than glitzy ambience, in keeping with the town itself, which is quite delightful and well worth the two hours and forty minutes on the bus from Ljubljana. Having a car is probably not worth the bother, as parking is expensive or out-of-town, and you can walk everywhere anyway, or even rent a bike.As for the swimming, it’s either from concrete jetties in front of the hotel, from the rocks towards the headland where the lighthouse stands, or from more concrete platforms around the north side of the promontory, facing Trieste. Alternatively, if you are a little more adventurous, you can walk along a seaside path leading from the back of the church towards the little resort of Fiesa (again, on the northern side). This takes you to a pebbly shoreline that is dotted with little pathways into the water that people have made by removing the bigger stones. It is also popular with naturists, if this is the sort of thing you are into (or alternatively if this is likely to cause shock and horror). The water here is crystal-clear and you are less likely to be bombed by eager youngsters diving in. Amusingly, there are no “health and safety” ‘No Diving’ signs to be seen on the concrete platforms in Piran, but there IS one prominently displayed on the long swimming jetty in Fiesa.The town of Piran is a little gem, full of twisty narrow streets and art galleries, and a million miles from the concrete bombast of Tito-era Portoroz (now with hot and cold running casinos as well as vast hotels) just down the coast.Thanks for an enjoyable stay!;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Good seafront location.;4;22.06.2012;Stayed in this hotel for four nights in June 2012. We were upgraded to a suite which was very well appointed and clean. The lady on reception (mornings) during our stay could not have been more helpfull and always had a huge smile and a pleasant attitude. The suite had a stone balcony overlooking the seafront so views were excellent. As mentioned before, the downside was that it was noisy at times until very late as people seemed to congregate on the concrete seafrontage under our window. We were also disturbed in the early hours by people who we presume may have been going home from the nearby night club. The breakfast is provided in the 4th floor panoramic room . Provision was quite varied with slight variation each day and all items keeped well stocked. The lady mentioned above quickly arranged attention to a minor fault in the room and also arranged that the hotel mini bus take us back to the out of town parking. Maybe if contacted beforehand, they may come and collect clients rather than having to drag cases on the sometimes crowded free shuttle bus to the square. I would warn people than when we went to leave the parking, the machine would not take any cards nor 50 euro notes. However an attendant did deal with the situation and let us out manually. The hotel is in a magnificent location and we tried several local restaurants all of whom gave good service and value for money. My only other comment is that, even though it was abnormally hot for the time of year, the a/c unit in our room did not cope adequately so it became quite hot at night.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Must have a sea side view;5;15.04.2012;We thoroughly enjoyed out stay at hotel piran because of (1) the clean sea side room, (2) the accommodating staff (each spoke multiple languages including German and English, and (3) the large breakfast spread which was included in the room.Other reviews noted noise from a bar nearby, we however did not notice any noise. This may be due to re fact that we stayed there in the off season.The room price may be a little high, but definitely worth it for the AMAZING view of the sea.You are allowed to drive your car into piran to unload your bags (challenging due to the narrow streets) and then a hotel attendant will shuttle you back to the parking garage which is outside of piran (only 12 euros to park for 24 hours).Wifi is not free... Hourly rate of almost 2 euros/hour.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Very OK hotel in a great location;4;2.04.2012;Hotel Piran is a nice city-tourist hotel in a fantastic location- take a room sea view. The view towards the sunset from the room is divine, the little balcony just right for that. The hotel is also smack in the middle of the old town, with great cafes, restaurants etc all in short walking distances. Rooms are nothing to write home about but functional and clean, staff VERY helpful and nice, breakfast buffet (included) was a bit on the cheap side.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Check out sea view with booking;4;26.10.2011;Hotel was lovely and our stay was the most memorable of our vacation after we changed rooms. When you book a room, make sure you are getting the sea view room that you really want. Level 4 has a balcony with a cement wall so you can't see the water unless standing up. Level 3 has iron railing but only one person can stand out on balcony at a time. Level 2 is only on the 1st floor and has a balcony with table and space and truly sea view. Level 1 (like Level 2) has a larger balcony and only on the 1st floor. There are probably only 3 or 4 rooms with Level 1 and 2 balconies and all on first floor. There is no privacy between the balconies on the 1st floor other than a small divider. Luckily for us and unfortunate for others, we were the only ones enjoying the sunsets from the balcony. We live where beautiful sunsets are common but the sunset we had the first night was superb...might have been the best sunset I've seen as the sunlight was cascading across the water -- we only have land. Cost of rooms vary by level of Sea View. Rooms on city side truly don't have balconies.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Boxy Hotel with a concrete beach, but convenient;3;5.10.2011;Nothing special except a very convenient location to roam the waterfront, squares and Venetian-like back alleys of Piran. Staff was mixed: some helpful, some indifferent. Easy to get to lots of restaurants. Great sunset...along with a balcony make it worth the seaside room price uptick.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Close to sea;4;27.09.2011;Situated right on the beach (the concrete walkway along the sea). City is super small so it it also close to everything else. Seaside rooms are worth all extra money you got! Super beautiful. Rooms were clean and good but a dark blue carpet and brown narrow hallways made the hotel feel old and unmodern. Breakfast was ok. Staff spoke english and german and maybe more languages. WIFI in rooms but not for free. A loud bar (Teatre Bar) is close to the hotel, might ruin your nights sleep if you don't close the balcony doors.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Perfect location in Piran;3;18.09.2011;Good value for money at this basic 3 star hotel. Rooms were tidy and clean. Our air conditioner was broken on arrival but the staff had it repaired within 20 minutes of our mentioning it. The bathroom was clean but the shower drained slowly. Towels were a bit small, not suitable for the beach. Breakfast is included and the room had a great view of the Adriatic. the food was basic but the staff were friendly.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Expensive hotel in need of refurbishment;2;4.09.2011;"Given the limited options in Piran, no wonder this hotel charges high rates for tiny rooms with old furniture, old dirty carpet, old towels. TV with only local channels. Their Wifi hourly rate is a rip-off. Breakfast was OK; there are a few tables on the terrace overlooking the sea. We had a sea view room and there was loud music from one of the bars along the promenade until quite late. The only positive things were the great location and the nice sea view from our room.Rather than staying at this expensive below-average hotel, perhaps Piran would be best visited as a day trip from Ljubljana.";Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Old world charm (and facilities) in the very best location;4;1.09.2011;We had a lovely night at the hotel piran as part of a little family roadtrip through Istria and the alps. The location is *dreamy* right on the harbor. The roads are closed to cars, but the let you in to unload and pack up right in front of the hotel, so it's actually very convenient. Our room was small and nothing fancy, but you can tell that once this was the very nicest place in town. Breakfast on the patio was idylic, and the staff was helpful and kind to our two young children. Piran is very charming - our favorite stop in Istria - and Croatia is in general a better value than Slovenia or Italy. We were very happy with our stay.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Great hotel, perfect location;5;26.08.2011;I can't fault my stay here. Good, clean reasonably sized room, excellent and plentiful buffet breakfast, warm helpful reception staff, superb location.As it's in the heart of the town the evenings can be noisy at weekends during tourist season (there was revelling well into the early hours of the morning!) - this didn't bother me at all but light sleepers might prefer somewhere a bit less central.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
"\Nice location and view but the hotel is very dated\""""";3;12.08.2011;My friend and I stayed in Hotel Piran for only one night but one night was really enough. Hotel Piran was probably a really cool updated place back in the late 70s or early 80s but now it looks and feels a little dated. The owners need to invest some money into painting the rooms, doors, breakfast room, and exterior in order to bring it up to date. The hotel staff was nice and it was not an awful place, but just a hotel that I would not want to revisit. The only thing really going for the hotel is the location on the water. You can sit on the balcony, where the paint is chipping off the white painted wrought iron, and watch the sun set which is nice. The whole time I was at the hotel I kept thinking about what I would do to fix it up if I were the owner, since it could be restored if enough money was pumped into it.Regarding Piran:, it is a nice place but a bit slow. I had visited Piran once before about twenty five years ago and it is about the same now as it was then. The town is pretty and you can easily tell that it was an outpost of the Venetian empire because much of the architecture reminds you of Venice. It is rather small and you can easily walk around the whole place in an afternnoon and see about all there is to see. I have been at many towns along the Italian and French coasts and most are filled with quaint shops and stores but if you like shopping Piran does not have much to offer. There are a few good restaurants though. Lastly if you arrive by car in Piran you have to park in a parking garage at the top of the hill before you drive down to Piran. You can then take an elevator to the bottom level of the garage and walk about 100 ft to a parking lot that has a bus stand. The buses will take you into the old town for free, you could always walk to the old town unless you have a lot of luggage to pull/carry. My impression of Hotel Piran and Piran.. the hotel needs to be 'restored' and Piran is okay, but I have now seen it twice and probably won't be back.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Unparalleled views but really noisy;4;11.08.2011;We just returned from a European vacation with family - two small kids and extended family members. Had visited Piran previously but had not stayed before. The rooms were nice - with two kids we had a suite which was great - very spacious and this was the kids favorite hotel of the 5 we stayed in. Balcony overlooking the Adriatic which was amazing but the noise level at night was ridiculous. I don't know if it's just the time of year we went or what but it started with loud club dance music at about 6pm-10pm when the live band started up. The first night they played until 2:20am. The hotel overall was nice, clean, decent breakfast, comfortable beds.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Late night noise from nearby bars;4;1.08.2011;After an initial debate on our booking, the agency hadn't forwarded on our revised dates. We were allocated standard rooms for the night before moving up to superior rooms, ( worth the extra euros). The hotel has been updated and is comfortable, with lovely sea views. Unfortunately, the bar on the corner had very loud live music every night until after 1 am, with nothing the hotel could do about it only apologise.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Nice hotel - great location;4;29.07.2011;Highly recommend - Piran is a lovely seaside town maintaining lots of its historic features. More for the quiet traveller rather than if you are looking for exciting night life etc.A great place to get away from it all. The hotel was very pleasant with great views at breakfast! Could be a little noisy on the street side but that is the price of narrow side streets I suppose. Food was great and the hot chocolates are bizarre but highly recommended if you like chocolate!;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Great Hotel. Great Location;4;15.07.2011;Piran is a fantastic location for chilled holiday. The whole place is beautiful & largley unspoilt with just enough to do if you get bored with relaxing. Its also because of its location a great place to visit other interresting places such as Venice, Trieste, Ljubljana & the Croatian Istrian peninsular.The Hotel Piran is is also in a fantastic position with one side of the holel overlooking the Adriatic, get a room on this side with a balcony if you can. If they are not available book one on the street side but ask for a high floor. The high floor gives great views over Piran & is high enough to reduce the noise coming from the street below.The staff in the Hotel Piran are all friendly & helpful as well as being multi lingual. The hotel itself is clean & the food is good.This is the second time I have styed in the Hotel Piran & it will not be my last. Highly recommended.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
We loved it!!!!!!;4;10.07.2011;We were greeted by lots of smiles when we arrived. We got there at 12.30 pm and our room was ready. All the staff were exceptionally helpful and obliging. Food at night was always a good selection and plenty of it (buffet style). Our table was outside overlooking the sea so we could watch the sunset each evening whilst eating our meal. Breakfast was adequate (continental) and took place on 4th floor so you had wonderful views during breakfast time.Good coastal walks, bus station a short walk away, plenty of little bars and restaurants.

This hotel was a great gift!!!The reception could not have been nicer!!!!I had a few issues with internet connection...but again the front desk was helpful in getting me connected...trying 3 passwords till we got it right.The hotel could use some updating for sure.....but the location, cleanliness, breakfast, views and service made it well worth every penny!We loved this little town and in our opinion, there is no better hotel in Piran!!;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
The staff was ignorant and not helpful at all;2;5.06.2011;We just got back from a trip to Piran and I have to say that I was utterly disappointed with the service at Hotel Piran. All the while I had the feeling the reception desk could not be bothered to deal with us correctly. Was it that we stayed only one night? No one advised us about their car park next to the hotel. We made the trip to the car park outside of the center and had to pay 12 Euros for the parking overnight. When I wanted to check out the next morning I was waiting at the desk for ages until the lady could be bothered to deal with me. On the receipt it did not say my name and after pointing that out, the receptionist became rather unfriendly. The location is very nice and also the room was clean but all in all heavily overpriced, also the breakfast buffet, varied but nothing special. Cheap products for a cheap hotel...

Disappointing experience despite lovely location;2;21.06.2010;We recently stayed at Hotel Piran for 2 nights. Unfortunately our stay in this hotel was not a great experience - we were situated in the old part of the hotel in a very shabby and dated room with the bathroom in particular being very poor. The air con in the room was barely working which made for very uncomfortable nights as we visited during a hot weather spell. We complained about this on the first day and a member of staff visited the room, however was unable to improve the air con and said a different member of staff would look at it the next day - this didn't happen.The breakfast selection was decent however the air con appeared not to work in the breakfast room either!On the plus side the hotel is right on the sea with lovely views of the Adriatic.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Brilliant location;4;15.06.2010;Just returned from Hotel Piran and really enjoyed our stay. We arrived at the hotel mid afternoon and were told there was a spare parking space so we could use it for our stay of 3 days. This was very useful and we had to pay the hotel 12 euro per day instead of the public car park. Each day we had to ask for a pass so that we could exit the town at the barrier. A bit complicated but it obviously works for them. The hotel is situated in a fantastic spot approx 12 metres from the sea. Our room was on the 2nd floor and looked as though it had recently been refurbished. The bathroom was modern and very clean. We had a minibar in the room and the prices were the same as you would pay anywhere which was really good.Unfortunately the air con was not too good and the room was very hot at night, sometimes we opened the balcony door but could hear noise as there is a path directly below the rooms. However, the position of the hotel is what makes it and a little noise is a small price to pay. We could lay in bed and hear the waves lapping only a few feet away. There is a concrete sunbathing area by the sea and you can hire sun loungers from the hotel for 3 euros per day. The only down point is the breakfast room. It is far too small for the amount of rooms, although there was a good choice of food. Please note they only have fruit teas and Earl Grey so take your own English tea bags!!Piran itself is very quaint and charming with excellent fish restaurants and a few bars. Prices are reasonable. The people are extremely friendly. It's a place we would love to return to.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Lovely location,no parking and not very helpful staff;3;23.04.2010;This hotel is in two parts - old and new and we were booked into the old part because we were only staying 1 night. Old rooms are quite dated with inadequate sound proofing. Noise from the bar kept us awake until 1 am. we asked to move rooms from the street side and were told that this was a problem because we had used the room ! When we arrived in Piran our route was blocked because car parking in Piran itself was full, so we parked about 1km away up the hill for 12 Euros per night. Hotel Piran does not have a cra park, but the hotel minibus did take us back to get our suitcases. On the way back the next morning we were directed to the free bus which left us with a walk through a building site to the upper car park . Breakfast was not great, but OK in the Panorama room. Piran is lovely, but next time I would just stay in a B&B up the hill.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383

You've got to get to Piran;4;31.08.2009;First of all, Piran is a great spot. Small and compact but massive charm and simply beautiful. Young couples, older couples, families.......this place is for everybody.So, Hotel Piran. We stayed here for 4 nights in a sea side room on the ground floor. The room itself was not massive, but certainly wasn't too small. Anyway, all you need is a bed to put your head down at the end of the day, right? Good sized bathroom with a great shower. Nice and powerful. The ground floor rooms have a small little patio area to themselves through french doors. Great to sit out looking at the sun go down with a couple of beers.We initially thought it might be a bit of a security risk, but it was fine. The rooms on that side on the higher floors have balconies, so same experience up there I guess. From the patio its about 5 metres to the sea, and in between the patio and the sea is the path and what I'd call some form of promenade. But basically people get a spot there early and sunbath and swim for the day.Only real problem with the room was the air-con. Seemed like it worked fine, but didn't cool the room down at all, even at full blast. The problem was the unit is positioned just above the door to the room. Between the door and the actual bedroom there a small hall area. At the end of that there's the door into the bedroom. This space was cool, but the bedroom wasn't. Above the second door, there's glass. I reckon if they remove that the cold air might get in to the bedroom. Even with the door open, it didn't.The breakfast in the hotel was quite good. Lots of breads, cereal, fruit, yoghurts etc. Didn't check out the hot breakfast stuff. I know there was definitely scrambled eggs so I'm presuming the usual others were there. Breakfast room is up on the fourth floor. Get there early if you want to get the seats outside on the terrace looking out over the Adriatic!The location of Hotel Piran is perfect. Right around the corner from the square, the best restaurants on right next door and right on the sea.Would recommend renting a bike (1 euro per day) from the place around the corner and cycling along the coast to Portoruz for a few hours aswell. More built up place but good spot to spend a couple of hours. Its only about 10 minutes by bike along the coast at a snails pace.Overall, Piran is a beautiful place I need to get to again. Good for a quiet, relaxing stay.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Great hotel;4;16.08.2009;We traveled to Piran just before they joined the European Union and, at the time, the dollar was worth more than the euro. In any case, we stayed at the Hotel Piran and had a great time. Piran is a compact beauty on the Adriatic and Hotel Piran is all that you would imagine. On the water, wonderfully located, not real fancy, great detail by the loyal staff. Adrianna was our favorite desk person (she is still there) and even arranged for laundry to be done at a very reasonable price. I will not say what we paid then, almost ridiculous by today's standards, but it is worth the price to be in the heart of the town, on the Adriatic, and steps from the best sea food restaurants in the area.;Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Quaint hotel with a great location on the water in Piran;4;28.04.2009;"First, TripAdvisor lists this as \Hostel Piran\"" but it is not a hostel. It is the Hotel Piran. There is a youth hostel a bit further inland.Anywho, on our first visit to Slovenia, my partner and I stayed here towards the end of April and were pleasantly surprised by the size of our suite. Separate living area with adjacent toilet/sink and two sinks w/shower adjacent to the bedroom (w/bidet - strangely not with the toilet).Large walk-in closet/changing area and spacious patio which overlooks the beautiful harbor and walkway that winds its way around the docks and so forth - nice for people watching.The hotel is older, the king bed was, as we've become accustomed to in Europe, two twins/full size beds pushed together and covered with king linens (don't fall into the crack!). The furnishings were, again, older but everything was kept clean and neat.The staff are multilingual, and very friendly and helpful about anything you may need. Right across the road is a tourist bureau wth an equally helpful gentleman.The rooms include a nice breakfast with hot and cold items, and some typical european fare. The auto coffee machines really didn't put out what we'd term typical capuccino or espresso drinks. But the great thing about breakfast is where it's served: truly a panoramic view of the Adriatic sea which was spectacular.wi-fi is available in the hotel for 2.50 euro/30 minutes (to be used at one sitting). It's reliability was a bit spotty. Some of the casual bars along the waterfront give you 30 minutes free on their computer (or wi-fi to your laptop) with any purchase. I found a nonsecured wi-fi connection near \""Bar Aroma\"" in the square that required no credentials and was high speed.Realize that if you plan on taking public transport from Italy, boat service to and from Venice is seasonal and usually from a nearby town. Bus service to/from Trieste, Italy is ONLY weekdays (though frequent). If you need a taxi to Trieste Rail station it'll be 49 euro and to the airport 89 euro, so plan accordingly (bus was only 5.40 euro).Quick note about Piran - don't expect any fancy shopping or boutique stores - this is old country charm at its best and there is some reasonably good food to be had. If there's a festival in the main square GO TO IT! It was the highlight of our trip with a arts/crafts/fleamarket going on and live entertainment that ran the gamut (marching bands, singers, classical bands, etc) - lots of fun. Beer/snacks/coffee are served at a variety of little restaurant/bars in the square. And a little hiking up and around the narrow streets wil reward you with breath taking views of the surrounds. We even stumbled onto a hidden rocky beach with someone nude sunbathing with his friends/family. This was off the beaten path a bit, but doable with the right shoes and strength.""";Hotel Piran;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelPiran;Stjenkova ulica 1, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.528023;13.5667383
Lovely position;4;31.05.2017;The hotel Tartini occupies a lovely position in Tartini Square. We had a room on the 3rd floor with a balcony and a view of the harbour. Our room was somewhat dated and in need of some maintenance but it was adequate.Space was tight- room for the beds and not much else. We had only net curtains so the light woke us up early and the argument that there were shutters did not help as we couldn't move one of our shutters. Also other people closing their shutters at night made it noisy. We only had 1 power point in our room-a good thing we had taken our extension lead.The bathroom had a good shower but because of the layout of the room there was no light at all in the shower area. They must save a lot on their toiletry bill as the shower gel dispenser made it difficult to get any out.The breakfast was nice but coffee was often in short supply.Our dinner was taken at the cafe in the square which was lovely but the menu was very limited. Often only 2 choices of starter and main course and only ever 1 dessert. The food was nicely cooked but we felt a 3* hotel charging a lot for Half board should have provided a better choice. With Inghams we had a free glass of wine with our dinner-a glass containing 0.1cl of wine.The wifi was very poor. It worked fine in the bar but in our room we could only get wifi on the balcony and then you had to put a complicated code in every time you logged on. Every couple of days the code expired so you had to get another one.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Perfect Piran location. Tiny room.;4;28.05.2017;"The Hotel Tartini is directly on the town square in Piran, and has a wonderful rooftop deck that you may not realize; easily accessible from the 2nd floor with great views of the square, church and marina. The location can't be beaten, but the room I had was miniature. The bathroom was good-sized and had a very good shower, but the sleeping room space was virtually no larger than the bed along with space for a tiny desk and chair....but, there was a balcony that was also right on the square which was very romantic (if you want romance; I was solo in my room). The free breakfast was massive and fantastic. The place was clean and the front desk staff was very helpful and spoke perfect English. Lots of restaurants and bars are located around the corner along the waterfront which isn't obvious right away. If you're going to Piran I would recommend this hotel so long as you don't need to spend much time in the room (due to it's size). If your travel itinerary is tight, however, I would skip Piran altogether and spend more time in Ljubljana, Rovinj or the area around Bled.";Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Amazing Location;4;31.03.2017;After arriving via push bike into Piran's main centre and seeing its stunning scenery we saw our hotel. Our room view was spectacular and straight out of a book. Small but very adequate and clean. Location Location what else can you ask for?So a glass of wine to watch the evening sunset was to die for. The hotel service was exceptional helpful and breakfast was lovely and healthy.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
The best view ;4;27.03.2017;We got a room with the best view of the Tartini square. The room was clean, the rooms are outdated but funcional. The staff was really nice and helpful.

The best location in the heart of Piran;4;6.03.2017;The hotel is located on the Tartini Square (the cenral sguare in the old city) - really excellent location. Our room had a sea view, a lot of people rather wanted view on Tartini Square, where is the centre of events. The room was with balcony, where are towo chairs and a little table. The size of room was good. The equipment is older - but this is hotel with *** stars :-):. The hotel has the best roof terrace in Piran. Beautiful view on all beautiful city Piran.We had just breakfast. Good. Enough choice of food. You got really coffee. The staff are very friendly and helpful. They had special offer for parking hous. We will be back for weekend. But not in the high seasons.

Average;3;22.10.2016;The hotel is very centrally located, overlooking Tartini Square. The staff are all very friendly and helpful, as are many Slovenes I encountered in very beautiful Slovenia. But the building and facilities are old. The wifi works very intermittently and the bathroom facilities are very old. The breakfast is good though!;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Good looking hotel in a great location.;4;5.10.2016;Overlooking the main square, the hotel is in an excellent location. Some of the rooms have a sea view, although buildings partly obscure it. The staff are great, being friendly, helpful and fun. The design of the building is stylish and the new bits blend well with the old, with ramps helping to link the sections of the buildings on the upper floors. There are some issues. Our room had a pillar in the middle and odd projecting shelves, both of which could be a problem if you are wandering around in the dark. Why would you do that? Well the electrics were a bit dated and the only way I could turn off the bedside light was to unplug it, an operation which is harder to reverse at night. The breakfast was good, with lots of choice at the buffet and there are facilities for cyclists which will appeal to some. Despite the small problems we had a great stay and would be happy to return;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Piran on your doorstep;5;5.10.2016;We had a comfortable room on the fourth floor with a fantastic view of the harbour and sea. The room was large enough for our week stay with plenty of wardrobe space. The hotel has a good lift service and a beautiful roof terrace overlooking Piran's main square and harbour. Apart from the obvious benefit of being in the centre of Piran, our stay was made even more enjoyable by the engaging, helpful and very friendly staff who made us so welcome. We have previously stayed in a very upmarket 5 Star hotel in the centre of nearby Portoroz, which was also a great experience, however, we are already looking forward to our next stay at the more intimate Hotel Tartini.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Interesting mix of old and new;4;4.10.2016;We arrived after no sleep for over 20 hours of air travel so the large, comfortable beds were a welcome sight. Although we had a limited view of the harbor, it was a pleasant area to be situated in-right on the main square. There are several great restaurants around the harbor area and some cute shops to purchase local objects.Our room was a bit of a mix-very old building with more modern added pieces-pleasant though.. Nice and interesting art work in halls. The staff were very pleasant.

Unusual hotel in good location!;4;18.09.2016;The Hotel is a surprise when arriving in darkness in the evening. We were dropped off at a small dark alleyway between tourist shops at the end of which is an illuminated hotel sign. We were initially disappointed with our room particularly the next morning when we discovered our view of the sea was partly blocked by buildings and our balcony very small. The room was fairly bland, with quirky furniture but the reception area and stairwells were like a modern art gallery!Breakfast was taken in a large, modern dining room with an extensive range of hot and cold food. This was excellent throughout the week and well serviced by the staff. We had initially expected the evening meals would be served here but as few people were on half board our evening meals were taken on the hotel's café on the main square. The meals were chosen from the same menu each night which was sufficiently extensive to satisfy us for the week. Piran itself is very interesting with much to see within easy walking distance. If you fancy a longer walk it is a pleasant coastline stroll to the more modern resort of Portoroz which is full of large hotels, coffee shops, bars and with extensive facilities for children. About 45 minute walk each way, buses are available if preferred.Whilst we were there, the Hotel did seem to cater largely for tourists on the move, including cycling groups, which meant a high turnover of people.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Very helpful staff in my hour of need!;5;17.09.2016;This hotel in Piran was the last stop for us, a group of friends who spent 6 days cycling from Ljubljana to the coast. I arrived in a state of panic because , during our bike ride from the hotel where we stayed the previous night, I realised that I had left my wallet there. Several calls to that hotel had produced no result but when we arrived at Hotel Tartini, David in reception was particularly helpful, ringing the other hotel on my behalf ( unfortunately with no result, other than to be told that if I rang again to enquire about my wallet they would call the police! What??!!). David then rang the police for me and advised me on how to get to a neighbouring town to report my missing wallet at the police station. When I returned to Hotel Tartini from the police station I forgot to ask the taxi driver for my receipt. However, by 7a.m. the following morning , the receipt was there waiting for me......all arranged by hotel reception staff. I really could not wish for better service. Thank you staff at Hotel Tartini. Unfortunately the events of the day left little time to enjoy Piran which is a delightful city at the water's edge. I had previously spent one day there in December and it was lovely to see it in summer. The hotel, located right on the main square, is unassuming from the outside and the reception area is rather lacking in character but the bedrooms are very comfortable and clean and the A.C worked well. I had a restful night and got up early to a lovely breakfast. The wallet was never found.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

Reasonable hotel in good location;3;6.09.2016;Piran is a small town with few hotels and this hotel is not luxury level - but with effective (if a little noisy) air conditioning in the rooms, clean bathrooms and a central location it is reasonably good value.Breakfast was a pleasant buffet, with a variety of breads and savouries as well as the usual eggs and cereals. Plenty of teas and coffees too. You can eat outside (very popular) or in the restaurant which is part-glass - unfortunately their air conditioners were declared 'not working' which made meals inside rather hot and sweaty. There is a wonderful rooftop lookout where you can eat, drink or just sit - fabulous views. Very few people used the bar, which was rather lacking views but located outside on the second floor.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

The wifi was strong. Bathroom was clean and decent size.It was in the perfect position - central to everything.We would stay here again if we return to Piran.

Average at best;3;17.08.2016;The location is excellent but that is where excellence stops. The reception on arrival was pleasant but that stops there as well if you have any issues. Our a/c was not working except that the fan did move air--need to have on very hot nights. They cleaned the blocked from dust filter and it improved some but never as cold as other rooms we visited. Our room was so small, it was easy to stub toes and difficult to place luggage. The little patio was nice but it was noisy at night. Breakfast was fine but certainly not even average for Europe in our experience.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Super location & excellent service in Piran;4;12.08.2016;The location is as good as it gets, sitting right in the main piazza of the town with a phenomenal rooftop terrace and bar with beautiful views of the town, sea and marina. The hotel staff is extremely friendly (David in particular was very helpful and warm). Wifi worked well and the breakfast had a nice selection. If you have a car, there are only a few parking spots next to the hotel and you will likely have to park in the pay lot outside the city center (free shuttle bus to the hotel which comes frequently). The rooms are a bit dated, but clean and we had a nice balcony terrace. The air conditioning works very well during the hot summer days. We stayed with small children and would recommend Hotel Tartini and stay again.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Wonderful experience;4;6.08.2016;Perfectly situated on Tartini Square. We were given a warm welcome when we arrived. Our room was adequate, a good sized bathroom and air conditioning which was much appreciated as it was very hot during our stay. The room overlooked the square which was very busy until late at night but the noise did not disturb us. All the staff were friendly and willing to help. The decoration throughout was different than normal hotels. The roof terrace was a wonderful place to unwind in the evening. If we ever return to Piran we would definitely go back to this hotel.

Fantastic hotel in a breath-taking Piran;5;5.08.2016;I have visited Hotel Tartini already for the 2nd time. And I know for sure I will get back here again. The hotel is situated perfectly, right at the Tartini market, in the center of Piran, next to the quiet haven. You have a fantastic view from the hotel on the market and the Venetian house. The hotel offers very comfortable rooms, also for families. They are cleaned perfectly every day. The service in the hotel is extremely friendly and professional. The staff is always very helpful, friendly and they give you the feeling as if you were at home. Fantastic. The breakfast is included in the price of the room and is very elaborate: cold, warm, fruit, desserts, and offers food for people with various diet needs. Piran is definitely one of my favourite places in Slovenia, it is so unique and it looks as if taken out from a postcard. Hotel Tartini is also definitely my favourite hotel in Piran.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
You pay for the location. That's it.;3;3.08.2016;"As all the reviews say, the hotel is in a great location. However, the hotel itself leaves alot to be desired. I expect that they are trading on their great location and don't feel they have to improve on maintenance. Which is a shame. You walk into a dark, tired and drab reception; the area was covered in tourist leaflets so it felt like a budget hotel at a railway station and you're paying a premium. Loading our bags from the car and parking was a bit of a kerfuffle. This I understood as you can't park in town and have to bus in. Still a hassle though. Our room could have done with a lick of paint and the carpet, bed and linen had seen better days. What irritated me the most was that there were only net curtains and no proper curtains so you could see into your neighbour's room, so if you are a light sleeper you definitely need your eye mask and ear plugs. Aircon was below par and noisy. Not a good night's sleep. Redeeming factor was breakfast. Good selection of food and those with gluten intolerance were catered for with gluten free bread and soy milk. Staff were also helpful and friendly.";Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Perfect Location;5;2.08.2016;You can’t beat the location of this hotel. It is right on the main square in Piran and easy to access from everywhere. Even though the center of Piran is mostly a pedestrian zone, you are able to drive up to the hotel to unload luggage. The reception will then give you a pass to get out of the center of town for free and a key card to park in one of the garages. If you pay for the garage at the hotel, you also receive a discount. Instead of paying 17 Euro a day, you only pay 8. There is a free shuttle that runs every 15 minutes that will take you back to the center of town. The hotel itself is lovely. Our room was large and the bathroom spacious. The only negative for me was that the bed was much firmer than my personal preference, but other than that, everything was good. Wifi was also strong and we even had a little balcony that was great to use at night as we enjoyed a drink. The staff in the lobby were extremely helpful and ready to answer any and all questions. Eneja specifically helped my husband and I with several questions and was very kind and patient at all times. We originally received a recommendation for this hotel from a friend and would continue to pass on the recommendation to the next person.

Run down hotel but perfect location;2;31.07.2016;We were really disappointed with Hotel Tartini. The rooms are really run down (even though the facade and building is alright) and in our bathroom something vibrated and sounded like you were in the engine room of a big boat.

Perfect Location ;5;22.07.2016;The Hotel Tartini is a fantastic little hotel in the main square of Piran. You could not get more central. The welcome is warm and sincere and the reception desk staff were incredibly helpful particularly in explaining how parking works in Piran - do not take you car into Piran - leave in the multistorey car park just outside town - a courtesy bus takes you in!! The rooms were small but adequate and comfortable and if you have a balcony the views are awesome. The terrace bar perched over looking the square and marina is exquisite and makes you feel you are staying 5*.

Great location;3;22.07.2016;I booked two nights at hotel Tartini for my family and for our two friends, since it had a good rating on Tripadvisor. But we were a bit disappointed. Firstly the reception didn't find our bookings which wasn't a big deal to us, just not a good first impression, then they gave the wrong key to our friends making them go into some one else's room. The rooms were as clean as they could be but run down (also not nice interior, exterior very beautiful though!), carpets in hotel rooms where dogs are allowed doesn't seem very hygienic to me. We had also booked a room with view over the square but got changed to a room with sea view :( Our balconies also didn't seem at all as nice as all the floors under us which had tables and chairs. One day we got stuck in the elevator because it didn't say how many ppl it could take. There was also a disturbing sound/vibration in our room, although mainly in the bathroom, which made my husband nauseous. Air conditioning was very loud. On the positive side the location was the best we could ask for, just set on the beautiful main square and close to the sea. Breakfast was also good with a wide variety. Beds comfy enough. Staff mainly helpful and nice! All in all we would not stay here again.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
The Good News and the Bad News;3;20.07.2016;The good news is that the Tartini is right in the center of Piran, the breakfast was good, the staff nice, and the 5th floor room had a balcony open to the sky along with a sliver of sea view. The bad news is that the room was perhaps 9'x10' and the bed mattress was awful. Just because of the mattress,, I would not go back. While the linens were immaculate, there were lots of scrapes on the minimal furniture. The hotel Piran close by looked much better.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

Great Location in Beautiful Piran;3;7.06.2016;Located on the main square in Piran which also happens to be near the marina. Hotel is in a fantastic spot with nice views and walking distance to plenty of restaurants. Outside architecture of building is lovely. Inside, the rooms are a little tired but clean with ample space and a balcony. Unfortunately, when we stayed here, the a/c was broken and it was quite warm. We were informed that they tried to get the a/c service to come on Monday (the night we were staying at the hotel), but would not be able to come to look at a/c until Tuesday. This forced us to open the doors to our balcony which made the room a bit noisy. Young man at the front desk was most helpful. Breakfast was in a lovely setting with some views of the marina as well. Breakfast was good enough and included the standard, European fare for breakfast- bread, meats, eggs, cereal, juice, coffee.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Location is everything;5;4.06.2016;This was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. Not because it was super-luxurious, but it had everything that I want from a hotel. The location is amazing. I flung open the bedroom widow to reveal the main square of Piran at my feet. The centre of the town is traffic-free, and so quiet with a wonderful atmosphere. This will probably displease petrol-heads who expect to be able to park right outside their hotel, but for cycle-tourists like me, it was wonderful. The staff were very friendly and helpful.

Very friendly welcome, quirky, comfortable and in a great location;5;30.05.2016;I'll state from the outset that I really liked this hotel. This was our final destination of a five day bike ride from Ljubljana to Piran. The welcome was so friendly by the red haired lady who spoke very good English that we immediately felt we were at a decent place. She helped to store the bikes, arranged keys and told us our bags were in our room which was all done quickly and efficiently. An asset to the hotel.The room layout is quirky and unusual which I liked. Odd shaped furniture and mirrors etc with a decent sized balcony to sit on and watch the world go by. Room was very clean with TV and WiFi. Shower was incredibly powerful. If you sit in the reception area and look at the shape of the interior, it's not unlike something that Dali might design. A mixture of lines and curves, steps, ramps with art work adorning all the walls. The outside of the hotel with its tables and chairs looking out onto the huge square looks like an ordinary typical hotel. The inside however is quite different. Lots of corridors going off in different directions with a restaurant and bar upstairs with an unusual seating area perched right on top of the roof with fantastic views. You couldn't ask for a better location. Right by the sea and right in the square. Whilst we were there the square hosted an antique market and a wedding. It seems there is always some activity going on. As for the breakfast, I thought it had a great selection of food including lots of different types of bread, cheese, meats, fruit, cereals with the option of sitting outside in the morning which we took advantage of. Excellent place to stay in my opinion.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

Great location, good food and friendly service;4;30.09.2015;As mentioned by other reviewers Hotel Tartini is situated on the main square of Piran, a great location. We stayed for 10 days from September 9 in a room with balcony overlooking the harbour, a beautiful outlook.The room was vey clean and serviced daily. Yes the furniture is a bit dated but quirky and was prefectly adequate. Food was excellent and we can not speak highly enough of Tomas our waiter throughout who was charming, helpful and made our evening meal experience delightful. He really went out of his way to make dining a pleasant experience. The reception staff were also very pleasant and helpful and we would not hesitate to recommend this hotel. We would certainly stay there again.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Good location, excellent food!;4;28.09.2015;Piran is an older, quieter town than the nearby Portoroz ant the Tartini is an excellent base as it is located right on the main square. The Tartini was a little tired and needs updating, but the service of the staff, the cleanliness of the rooms/hotel & the food were excellent, and this overode the other comment. The beds were too firm(hard??) for out liking, but this is a personal preference.The main entrance to the hotel is right on the square, however the side entrance is via a rather rundown passageway, with a scooter/motor bike parked there. This is NOT part of the hotel, but wasn't the best way to arrive at the hotel. (I would suggest they close this off all together!)I would suggest asking for a sea view, which provides a view of the harbour, although there are other buildings in view (.i.e. it's not an unrestricted sea view).I would certainly recommend the hotel as a good base to see the southern part of Slovenia.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
"Tne \Nice, But\""-Hotel""";3;21.09.2015;The hotel is situated in the restricted traffic area of Piran. You can reach it by public shuttle bus from the parking garage (1 km apart) or by car passing a gate. The ticket you get there has to be counter-validated by a hotel permit you get from the receptionist and which has to be shown upon leaving the restricted zone.No unloading-/loading zone is in front of the hotel and not even in close proximity. Therefore you have to stay on one of the two lanes of the street for loading/unloading.The best rooms are those with balcony on the uppermost floor, which cannot be reached by the elevator. The last steep and narrow flight of stairs you have to climb with your luggage or stroller.The balcony doors have a shutter you like to close due to the mediterranean sun flooding in. Therefore each room on this floor has shutters. Unfortunately ours was warped, so it could not be interlocked and chapped permanently. Therefore neither the heat could be kept out nor the morning sunbeams.In the hotel lobby was a computer corner - without a computer. It was on repair and no replacement garment was available. Annoying!Breakfast can be taken inside or outside, wheather permitting. The offer is acceptable. The refills are quite fast.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Wonderful location, not so good hotel;2;18.09.2015;The hotel is located right on Piran's main square, a superb location.However, the rooms lack taking care of - a renovation is past due.I only had breakfast there, which wasn't great.Staff not very helpful.Air conditioning works, at the room but not on the breakfast room. Badly decorated.Still a wonderful location - Piran is one of the nicest towns in Slovenia (I've been to many towns here).;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Fantastic food but dissapointing room.;3;15.09.2015;This hotel is very difficult to rate because of the complete contrast between the bedroom and the restaurant. We had a room overlooking the square but found the bed extremely firm and the bathroom too small and poorly lit. In complete contrast the restaurant was fantastic! The meals were delicious, the sea trout cooked to perfection and the breakfasts were excellent! The restaurant had a very calm feeling of quality, with classical music played during breakfast. We are happy with bedrooms on the quirky side but ours was almost shabby.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Located right on the main square in Piran;5;15.09.2015;Piran is a spectacular place, and Hotel Tartini is located right next to the main square and harbor. All the sights are within walking distance including main bus stop. The staff were friendly. Rooms are clean and modern, and typical small size found in Europe. They include a nice breakfast. My room overlooked the main square and provided an amazing view of the square and Church Tower lit up at night. And during the day you could hear the music playing in the square.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

Enjoyable Stay;4;14.08.2015;Good location within the main square.The harbour and sea front walks are only a short walk away and the bus station is nearby.It was ideal for my wife and I who are retired to easily get about although Piran has a number of steep paths to negotiate to see the church and views.We stayed on half board for a week at the end of July and found everything to our satisfaction.We enjoyed evening meals in the outside bar area of the hotel overlooking the square.Great for people watching as many locals and families meet within the area.Our room overlooked the harbour and was spacious with a small balcony. Air conditioning was good beds on the firm side but comfortable.Good size bathroom with good over bath shower.Always plenty of hot water.Room 412 on 4th floor gave us good privacy and was quiet at night. Throughout our stay the staff were lovely be it at reception or in bar and restaurant. Very friendly and accommodating.Breakfast was good but not a huge hot choice.Eggs,sausage and cold selection but plenty to satisfy.Bacon was not on the menu. Evening meals were plentiful and varied and good value half board arrangement . We had a lovely holiday but don't expect the Ritz . We just enjoyed the laid back easygoing atmosphere in this somewhat quirky hotel.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

Well located but experience may depend on room;3;2.08.2015;We enjoyed our 2-night stay in Piran and were lucky to get a harbor view with balcony. Two of our traveling companions were disappointed in their rooms, so there is some variability. Baths are dated.Service was OK, but I didn't find it as helpful and friendly as other TA writers said. And no coffee was available until 7:00a. We ended up having to go to a restaurant nearby for our early morning joe.Best thing for us about this hotel is its location and GREAT air-conditioning (which we needed for the 90+ degree days). I think I'd prefer Piran in the spring or fall but it is a fascinating historic jewel.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

Location was very central, perfect for cafés, bars, restaurants and water front, not too far from swimming areas, either.Nothing to complain about really, breakfast was fine, nice if you wanted to eat al fresco as there were a few tables outdoors.

average rooms, but overall fine hotel in the heart of Piran;3;16.07.2015;The no 1 what Tartini hotel offers to its quests is the location (located on Tartini square which is the heart of the centre) - close to the sea and right in the centre. Hotel has also nice terrace and dining area and rich breakfast. On the other hand rooms were kind of basic for the price that hotel offers, fortunately with air-condition. Other disadvantage is absence of parking places (you can enter the hotel with car for 30-min check in and check out, otherwise you park in front of the village - however the bus transit is frequent)We had a room with square view and we had great view to the whole square!;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

a Gem;5;1.07.2015;on arriving in Piran which is a beautiful little place we came across the hotel at the end of a little alley way. I was very sceptical until we entered the bright and cheerful hotel. We were greeted by the most welcoming receptionist we had met so far. We had a long and tiring day and his welcome cheered us up no end. we were given a room on the 2nd floor which was large, bright and spotlessly clean with toiletries in the bathroom. Our view overlooked the lovely little square. There si also a rooftop terrace where drinks in the evening are a must. Breakfast was great, it was by far the freshest we had had served by the most delightful little lady who likes to mother all the guests. It also had the best choice of items we had been offered.In all I would definitely return to this gem of a hotel with the friendliest most helpful staff I have encountered in a long time.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Nice location in beautiful medieval town!;4;29.06.2015;We had room 508 (top floor - ocean view) for one night a few days ago. It had a nice balcony. It is not directly ocean front but you definitely have a nice view of the ocean and you can see adjacent buildings and the marina from your balcony.It's a little old but very clean, staff is very friendly and helpful. A/C worked well (we like it cold!), it was very quiet at night (we had heard that it could be noisy on the square side), very clean bathroom, awesome breakfast buffet with super friendly lady.One thing to keep in mind when you're on the 5th floor: the elevator stops on the fourth floor so if your suitcases are big and heavy, it's a little hard walking up the stairs with them from the fourth to the fifth floor.Wifi worked well. I was able to make VoIP phone calls with my laptop and my conversations were clear.I found prices to be very reasonable.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Location, location, location;4;28.06.2015;Bang on the side of Tartini Square, this hotel seems to be used a lot by tour groups, although when we were there solo travellers were also around. Mid-sized rooms, some looking out to the side with a balcony, others looking out onto the square without a balcony. it's not a four star hotel, but I've given it a four rating as it is good at what it does and the staff are friendly and helpful, as noted by other reviewers. Wifi works in the room, but my room didn't have a safe. The rooms have angular Habitat style furniture, which can stick out a bit (especially when getting up in the middle of the night and you don't want to turn the light on) and are a little form over function.Breakfasts are comprehensive and presided over by a mother hen of a woman who seems to genuinely want you to have a great meal - it's the usual fluorescent egg, ham, cereals, coffee etc, but all you could reasonably want. There's a roof terrace where you can eat at night and seats outside for coffee or a cheeky beer.A great place to stop for a couple of nights.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Great Location, Good Staff, OK Hotel;4;22.06.2015;Stayed here for just one night. The hotel is a bit like Piran itself, slight run down, and not 'gentrified' for the benefit of tourists, in the way that Budva, Dubrovnic and Kotor have been. The town of Piran feels very much like a lived in town as does the hotel.In the room the furniture is a strange style that would be more suited to an Alice in Wonderland cartoon with coloured doors and draws and shelves in lots of places - giving you plenty of opportunity to forget things when you depart.The bed was comfortably enough, with a firm mattress. The bathroom, old and tired. When we stayed there was a long thunderstorm late evening, and that probably helped contribute to the leaking roof in the restaurant where breakfast was served. Well done to the ice bucket on the table next to me catching the water.Breakfast was OK. Unfortunatly, the roof top terrace was not open so didn't get the benefit of what must be fantastic views from there. Breakfast could have done with a more wider choice, but what I tried was good, very nice cakes. Not so sure about the scrambled eggs, the lack of cleanliness in the serving tray put me of so didn't give it a try. The crazy/friendly lady working in the restaurant was different as was the singing receptionist. Entertaining.In truth if this hotel was anywhere other than the best location in town (if you prefer town square views over sea views), and the staff were so friendly, i would have given this no more than a three star rating.What this hotel needs is a major refurb and they could charge at least 50% on the room rate.Parking was on the edge of the town with a discount for guests (7.50 Euros for overnight parking out of peak holiday season) A free bus was available to within 50m of the hotel.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

Good 3 star with excellent staff;4;31.05.2015;We stayed one night in the hotel tarting, we had booked a non refundable room and I tried to cancel as we were delayed and were offered a night the following day. Most hotels would just pocket the money and rely on the booking conditions. The staff were great. The lady behind reception with red hair was particularly helpful, we asked for directions to Ljubljana and they printed in Slovenian, she hand wrote in English next to each step, nothing was too much trouble. The rooms are a bit plain and basic but clean. You have to park just outside the town and get the bus in but it wasn't too much of a problem.

The staff here are just wonderful. The hotel lacks some amenities (like stuff to make coffee in your room) and services (like room service) that prevent a higher rating, but the location is great and I couldn't ask for a nicer room on Tartini Square.

Fantastic staff, great location, but don't expect a high standard hotel;3;14.05.2015;The kindest staff ever, excellent location, but definitely in need of a renovation. This is not a well kept 3 star hotel, they get the business because of the location and the wonderfully helpful and most friendly staff, the beds are comfortable, the rooms are decent size, the linens and breakfast are fine, but the hotel, room decor and bathrooms are very quirky and in need of a desperate deep cleaning and renovation. The Hotel Piran is the best hotel in town, so if you are unable to book there, this will be a good option. Ivanna provided excellent restaurant recommendations at Sappori dei Bottega and Pira Mara, so follow her advice and avoid the trendy over priced tourist outlets that some staff and others may recommend. Just hope for the hotel and future guests sake the owner invests in a nice renovation, then this would be a super choice in Piran.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Great stay in Piran;5;8.05.2015;We booked this hotel at the last minute but it turned out to be a fabulous choice. We were fortunate to get a very nice room with a view of the harbor. The breakfast was great and they gave you a discount on the parking at the garage. The staff was also very good, particularly David the morning desk man. His non-stop string of jokes and one liners was the highlight of our stay. I'm only sorry we didn't get his picture. Piran is small but a very nice place and just right to give the flavor of coastal Adriatic city.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Helpful team - good location;4;13.04.2015;One night stay here when Ryan Air moved our flight time back and we found ourself landing at 9.30pm over the border in Italy. A quick trip into Slovenia (40 minutes) and you arrive in Piran. I was last here about six years ago and had forgotten how nice the place is. Lovely harbour, big architecture and still very much a working town.The front desk team were very helpful, just as other reviewers mentioned. Room was clean and had a good view of the sea. Good breakfast in a nice room in the morning.One word of warning for Piran - the centre is reserved for local cars so you will need to ask the front desk for a car park voucher for the multi-story about 10 minutes away.

A good choice for a short stay;4;29.03.2015;Since I'd only planned to stay one night in Piran before going to Trieste, all I wanted was a room in a centrally located decent hotel. Even though Piran is a small town, the location of Hotel Tartini (right in Tartina Square) cannot be beaten. My room (No. 304) was a little bit small and the bathroom looked kind of old style to me. However, it's clean and decent and there's a balcony with a beautiful view of Tartina Square. There're cracks on the walls of some parts of the hotel building and some refurbishment would definitely help. Also, my room wasn't well insulated from noise from other parts of the hotel and it's quite noisy in the early evening. Fortunately, the noise stopped when I came back from dinner. I'm sure there're better accommodation options in Piran. But as I said, I only stayed a night there and given the price of my room (76 euros), it's quite good value for money.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

Right on the Main Square;4;3.11.2014;Hotel is centrally located - right on the main square which can be good and bad! There was a political rally going on with loud music blaring until after dark when we were there and it was impossible to shut out the noise! The rooms were clean, but the decoration is a bit unusual to say the least - like something out of a Dali painting. I noticed that the common walls were cracked and peeling in some places.

Quirky furnishings that didn't quite work;3;20.10.2014;This hotel has a great location right on the main square. However, you can't park outside the door. There was quirky and colorful furniture in the room, which would have been fine if it had been functional. It was not. There was nowhere to put your case, except the floor and then you had to step over your case to get to the bathroom. My room had a little balcony with a table and two chairs and a view over the sea. If you left the shutters open during the night, they would bang against the wall, so had to be closed. There was poor lighting and only one power point for charging your electronic devices. There was no safe. In the bathroom they did have a laundry line which you don't see very often in hotels these days and was very welcome. There was a heater, walk-in shower, hair drier,and a noisy extraction fan and those awful soap dispensers that never seem to work. The toilet flush button was coming away from the wall, so it was hit and miss if the toilet would flush.They did provide a good breakfast.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

I could only find one socket in my room so I had to charge my phone, camera, laptop one at a time. I could not even leave something charging whilst I went to breakfast as the door would hit the plug.There wasnt much of a view from my room, there was no balcony.

Piran a delightful place to visit and Hotel Tartini is in such a great spot to watch all the comings and goings in the square.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Not as good as expected;2;28.09.2014;"I had never been to Piran, and stayed at Hotel Tartini based on the recommendation of a friend. The hotel location is great (directly overlooking the main square), but the hotel itself left something to be desired. I booked a room with a balcony, which faced west (away from the square, but towards the hot afternoon sun). The sun beating down on the balcony shutters all afternoon made the room very hot. Unfortunately despite the room being advertised to have air conditioning, it did not work. I called the front desk and they told me they'd turned it off because it was \cold outside\"" (I admit that it was maybe 65F / 18C at night outside, but 75F / 24C and sunny during the daytime, so the room was at least 80F / 27C). The woman suggested opening the balcony door, which I did, but this was ineffective since there were no other windows, so no airflow, and it also let in the fumes from people smoking on nearby balconies. Additionally, the beds were extremely hard (I like a firm mattress, but this was about the same as sleeping on the floor). The rooms were sanitary, though dirty in the sense that the walls had marks on them. According to the card given to us at check in, the \""Free WiFi\"" code was only good for one hour. The front desk staff were not particularly outgoing, though they were civil. They validated the parking at the Fornace parking lot, as advertised. The breakfast was pretty good, and the staff in the restaurant were much more friendly.I saw the Hotel Piran while walking around, and it appeared to be much nicer (based on what I could see of the restaurant, bar, and lobby through the windows). It overlooks the harbor instead of the square, but Piran is a small place and they're maybe only 200 meters apart. If I return, I will try that hotel instead.To summarize: Hotel Tartini has a great location and there are few options for nice hotels in Piran, but I was disappointed in the comfort and didn't find it to be a good value for the money (which was about $165 per night when I stayed).""";Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Right Where You Want to Be!;4;25.09.2014;Piran is a charming old world town and the Hotel Tartini is right on the town's square. We were fortunate to have a front facing room. Its French-style windows opened onto the square. I believe this was the best view from a hotel that I have ever seen. Breathtaking. The hotel itself was fine. A solid 3 star hotel, no more. But its location and a terrific breakfast make it one of my all-time favorite places. Just ask for the front-facing rooms. Its double windows block out any noise from the square.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

Very Old;3;26.08.2014;This hotel is right on the square in the middle of Piran. We were there for the Piran Festival. (First week of August) We enjoyed the view of the concert stage from our bedroom window, but it may not be to everyone's taste. We had The Beetles blasting out one night and the equivalent of Iron Maiden the next! We also enjoyed a ballet evening and local songs and dances on other nights.The breakfast was served in the dining room and was a well stocked buffet. We were the only people staying in for an evening meal (not something we would normally do, but it was part of the package we were on) and so all our meals were from a limited menu of steak, fried chicken or a whole fish.The staff were all attentive and no one pushed for your plate or made you hurry your meal.The room was small and uniquely decorated. The room was reasonably clean and had wooden shutters to keep out the sun and noise.One final comment our bed was like concrete and if you like a soft mattress do not book room 304!!!;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

Dutch Flying Club on tour;4;11.08.2014;With a group of 14 people on a tour with our Flying Club in The Netherlands we chose Tartini in Piran for a 5 nights’ stay, because of the magnificent location of Piran (and, convenient for us especially, a short taxi drive to the local airport) and the central location the hotel has in the town. All members of the group fully agreed with this choice. They enjoyed the stay very much and would highly recommend it for its location, kind reception and service, neat rooms and excellent breakfast service. Many things to do in the famous old city and its beautiful surroundings, many good restaurants in the old town.We look forward to our next visit.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

Great little hotel right in the centre of town;5;25.07.2014;Stayed here for just a single night on my way from Croatia up to Bled, wish I could have stayed longer as it's a really lovely place.It was a little hard to find at first so I should have done a bit more research. Once I found it I wondered how on earth I'd missed it. The entrance is right on the main square, though it is slightly obscured by the cafe out front.I had a lovely room on the 3rd floor with a partial view out to the harbour. Room was good size, comfortable and clean.Breakfast was very good and you can eat outside if you want.Parking is an issue in Piran so unless you're travelling with loads of luggage or have a long stay best to pack a small bag and use the main car park with free bus transfer which drops you right by the hotel.Would definitely stay again.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

Like An Onion There Are Many Layers;5;23.07.2014;"We were traveling with two other couples; all middle-aged. First impression is a nice hotel in a picturesque location. While presenting a small door off the square, it turns out the hotel actually occupies a very large area of attached buildings. We had a room looking out on the harbor; the small balcony had room for a chair which was very nice. Well made French doors were very effective in deadening outside noise. Air conditioning worked well. Beds were firm but supportive, and no backaches. Shower size is very small; very typical of Europe. Bathroom was decent size. Breakfast was extensive, and used a large dining area with inside and outside seating. There is literally something for everyone; coffee is up to Seattle standards.There are two outdoor seating areas for relaxing and drinking. One is off the second floor landing, and the other on the roof with awesome views. They have bar service for both locations. Unfortunately, the smokers are all outside as well.The contact with staff was helpful and cordial; all spoke English well enough for effective communication. This is in a pedestrian area; you can drive in to drop your bags and then you have to park in the town parking structure.

Great location and staff;4;13.07.2014;"We had a nice stay in Hotel Tartini and were disappointed we only had one night. The hotel definitely has a coastal/beach feel to it, but was clean and had a/c and a nice balcony. WiFi was a little annoying - only one hour free - but we could get the free Piran wifi by sitting on the balcony. Location is great, but access could be improved with a map; we drove right past where we were supposed to stop to drop off luggage. If you are driving and don't have a lot of bags, I would recommend just parking right away in the municipal garage and hopping on the free shuttle that drops you off in the main square (where the hotel is located). Breakfast was good as well, and there are plenty of tables inside and outside. The desk staff were very friendly and seemed to speak at least three different languages fluently. David at reception also made us a reservation at Casa Nostromo for dinner, which may have been one of the highlights of the trip.

The setting of an opera;4;10.07.2014;Piran is everything you hope Istria to be. An incredibly scenic little seafront village situated on a mini-peninsula, so there is no fear of any highrises spoiling the views.

The hotel itself is very well kept with a truly staff, very laid-back but with little details in the furnishings that distinguish it from your usual modern seaside hotel.

Excellent location, friendly staff;4;27.04.2014;A nice, clean hotel. The location is obviously its strong point. However, there's more than that. The staff is very helpful - we spoke to them about visiting a concert during our stay, and they surprised us with 2 free tickets for that concert. They apparently sponsor cultural activities in town and get tickets to give to guests. They didn't advertise it, the manager said, because they wanted to give the tickets to people who are really interested in the music and don't just want to go because it's free. You also get free parking space, although you can park your car right in front of the door to unload your baggage. The rooms are clean, spacious and air-conditioned.

Great location in Piran centre;4;19.01.2014;Access to the hotel is unpractical, and rules seem to change every now and then.

You do get a reduced price as hotel guest, but getting in and out is not easy, even impossible if there is no one at garage exit (e.g. in the evening or early morning)Hotel itself is lovely, from outside has all Mediterranean charm, while inside is rebuild in modern style.

View with a Room;4;14.12.2013;WIth the Adriatic Sea stretching out from our balcony, Piran became one of our all-time favorite spots on the planet. Tartini is a classic costal hotel with all the charm of the old country. The staff are exceptional and know the area and activities to keep you entertained, fed, watered and comfortable. The hotel sits in the center of everything and deserves an extra star for that. I really enjoyed walking out the door in the morning and being able to run along the boardwalk for miles without concern for traffic and seeing all the other places to visit once the day started. Upon return, we'd go and have breakfast which was fresh, local and plentiful. The other fun thing was sitting on the balcony and watching the harbor master direct yacht traffic in the tiny harbor. Always entertaining. We had great weather and there are bars and restaurants close by with outdoor seating. There was a wedding in the square and the whole scene had a welcoming, friendly feel.

It's the staff that make it...;4;11.10.2013;"Had been tipped off that this was the place to stay by my brother. Was tempted by the reasonable out of season rate too. I was given a wedge shaped room that looked over the fabulous piazza, it isn't really a square, and was once the inner harbour up to 1894. And the room has real shutters. It won't take you too long to explore Piran, two days max but some people do linger longer than the likes of me. The Tartini will prove a good base with plenty of cafes and restaurants near by. And if you didn't know who Tartini was, you soon will. Visit his house if you wish but the cds are much cheaper on the Internet! While the view over the 'square' is fab, it could be very noisey at night. The bedroom was nothing special and the bed rather too hard. Clean and functional throughout, the bathroom could do with a bit of maintenance. Plenty of hot water and good towels. Staff are lovely from the receptionists to the lady in the breakfast restaurant; they couldn't be more helpful, but this is not uncommon in Slovenia.

great location, great views;4;11.10.2013;Immediately fell in love with Piran, just driving up to the hotel. The location of hotel Tartini was perfect. Right at the town square where a Italian specialist market was beeing held (untill late at night, very enjoyable). And with al lovely taverne outside of the entrance, where we had a very nice lunch just after arriving, very relaxed, good food and soaking in the atmosphere and congratulating ourselves with yet another good choice of hotel.The man behind the desk was efficient at checking us in and providing us with all the information needed to quickly unload the Luggage before bringing the car to the car-park, just outside of the town. Efficient but a bit rushed, not unfriendly, but not very welcoming either. We felt he was maybe a bit tired (end of the season?) This was the only downside to our stay, and although this man never smiled at us or greeted us everytime we walked by (could have been te busy) and made us feel more like a number than a appriciated guest, the other staff more than made up for this! The lovely cleaning lady (who accidentaly walked in on me when I was just doing my hair and couldn't stop apologizing) the lovely, lovely lady at breakfast (had a good lauch with each other) and the other girls behind the desk. Hotel Tartini is a lovely hotel, with a beautiful terrace overlooking the harbour and town. We had a very nice (colourful and bit quirky but we like quirky) room with balcony and nice views of the harbour. A good bed and a good airco and a nice bathroom. We certainly recommand this hotel,due to location alone, sooo nice to go out in the evening for a good meal and than slowly return to your hotel in the middle of the square and just be happy with the place, the town, the people, the views, the atmosphere, loved it !!;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Charming and well situated;4;7.10.2013;If you come by bus, you have to walk a few hundred meters from the parking place to the hotel, as the village has some car restrictions.

Lovely location, but did not honor booking agreements;2;6.10.2013;Piran was a super cute town, and we loved it. Hotel Tartini is right at the bottom of the main street to drive in, and it faces the square. The room was quite large, and the breakfast was in a very nice place. The food was okay, not as great as Iwas expecting, but perfectly fine. My main complaint was we had booked the reservation through their website to get a 10% off mid week booking. When we were paying, they refused to honor it, said we had booked through hotels.com, which was totally not true. I showed them my email confirmation, and they wouldn't look at it and insisted we pay the full amount. I was pretty upset at how rude they were about it. If they don't want to honor the advertisement, then they shouldn't offer it. Otherwise, I would have rated this probably a 4.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

It's all about location!;5;30.09.2013;This hotel is located directly on Tartini Square in the heart of Piran. A perfect location to visit the old town, shopping, restaurants, port and nightlife. The rooms are quirky but cute and a good size. Although the building is historical, the interior decoration is quite modern. They have a nice outdoor terrace as well, and an extensive buffet breakfast in a lovely room with large glass windows.We found the bed quite hard (but others might prefer that), but it was fine for our one night stay. We loved our little balcony with sea view allowing us to relax outside late in the evening. The staff at the front desk was so pleasant and made us feel welcome. There is a free shuttle between the hotel and the car parking garage since you cannot park your car at the hotel.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Great location, nice staff, hotel shabby;3;28.09.2013;We chose Hotel Tartini for the location. It's directly on Tartini Square and in the heart of Piran. Great location. Accommodation prices reflect the location so I guess that's what you're paying for. The rooms are tired and quite shabby. The bed wasn't the most comfortable and bedding was basic. It was ok for a one night stopover but wouldn't want to stay longer. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Breakfast was continental style. Not the best quality but ok. If you have a car, park at the Furnace car park (multi storey at top of hill on entering Piran). There's a free shuttle to Tartini Sq and the hotel offer a discount on the ticket.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
The best location & great service in heart of Piran;5;27.09.2013;I visited Piran in Sep 2013 & glad that my friend chose this hotel - its very conveniently located to the central square, tourist info office, shopping & nightlife. You can walk to the town walls or the old church. Walk in the opposite direction for 3-4 minutes & you are at the bus station to catch your bus to other cities. The staff is super friendly, they suggested a restaurant - Nordstromo which was fabulous & we got special treatment when we mentioned that we were sent by Hotel Piran. Davide, who is generally at the front desk is cheerful, jovial guy who can give you lots of pointers. The staff also helped us book a taxi to Plitvice, Croatia - a travel which otherwise can be painful if you dont have a rental car.I am truly sad that I didnt spend another night at this hotel in Piran. I highly highly recommend it!;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Very nice place, good location & excellent service;4;21.09.2013;This Hotel is a very good example how a modern place could be well integrated in an historical surrounding !

Great hotel, central for everything.;4;19.09.2013;The hotel is situated on Tartinijev Trg, one side overlooking the square, the other overlooking the small harbour. As coaches are not allowed into the town, due to the size of the road, we had to walk along the harbour road with our luggage, this takes about 10-15 mins. Great if lovely weather, as it was for us. The centre of the hotel is an open atrium which gives the Reception area a spacious feel. There’s a lift and various ramps to access all floors. We were booked into room 209, overlooking the harbour. Nice sized room that included twin beds, en-suite, TV, fridge mini-bar and a small balcony. From the central atrium on our floor we could access the steps to the terrace on top of the hotel which overlooked the square & harbour. We visited the terrace once hoping to have a drink before we left for our evening meal but the staff were preparing tables for a meal and showed no inclination to serve us, even after we approached the bar.The buffet breakfast was lovely, fresh fruit, cereal, yogurt, cheese, cold meat, hot food and lovely cakes. We were told that you could order different cooked eggs and bacon but we didn’t use this option. There was plenty to choose from already.As we had to leave very early, 4.30am, for the airport, the hotel prepared a breakfast bag for each of us which I thought was considerate of them.As Piran is a small town the hotel was close to everything. I would stay at this hotel again if revisiting Piran.Due to the location of the hotel I do not think it matters which side your room is located, you are bound to have some noise. From our room we could hear the musical entertainers from the bar/restaurants by the harbour. They did appear to quieten down around midnight. The days we were there was the start of the Tartini Musical Festival so additional musical events were taking place, this could have accounted for the late performances.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Best for backpackers and light packers;3;18.09.2013;The view was beautiful, but -- getting to it was tough. No street or lot parking in town, fair enough, but the dark garage was a 1 kilometer bus ride and a hike down a couple of flights of stairs. We didn't want to leave bags in the car, so we hoisted and dragged them. We were on the 5th floor but lift stopped at the 4th. More hoisting and dragging. Ready for a beer at the roof bar, which is actually on the 2nd and 3rd floor, depending on who's counting. Alas, no chairs. We hoisted some a flight to our table. Alas, no cold beer. The white wine was nice, though and the red rooftops and Adriatic lovely. At dinner in town, an extraordinarily surly waiter. Breakfast at the Tartini was good. Internet complicated and usually non-functioning. We left earlier than planned, more hiking and dragging. If you need an accessible place, look elsewhere.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

The hotel is situated in the best location close to the square, bus station, swimming locations and great restaurants. The service from the staff was first class. Breakfast in the restaurant was very good, also with great, friendly service. Our room was very comfortable.

"\Tartini's Thrill\""""";5;12.09.2013;Piran is a wonderful and beautiful little town with loads of sight to visit and not as crowded as some of the Croatian towns such as Rovinj. The hotel itself was just perfect for us. We had a nice and comfortable room which was spotlessand clean. The hotel has a roof terrace from which you have a splendid view over the old town, the harbour and the Med while enjoying a glass of wine or food. ( Tip: if you go there before 6pm you have the place for yourself)The staff was just fantastic and our special thanks for all the information and help given go to the staff at the reception (David, Anja and Eneja and the night porter), the waiters (especially to Svetlana, Sanja and Branca) and the cleaning staff.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
A Little Gem;5;6.09.2013;I stayed here at the end of August as part of an Explore Group holiday. The hotel is right in the centre on town overlooking the main square. I was fortunate to have a double room to myself on the third floor overlooking the square so fantastic views and atmosphere right from my room.

Breakfast was in the main restaurant with outside seating and a very varied choice from ham and eggs to the whole range of fruits, meats and breads.

The staff was wonderful and spoke every language you could hope for (English, Spanish, German, Slovenian, and who knows what else). You don't even need to go to tourist information, they'll tell you everything you need to know right here. The room was simple and clean, everything we were looking for. Pay careful attention if you choose to drive here. You should enter town through the \guests\"" gate, take a ticket, then they will give you a pass at reception to get back out of town free. You will park (for a discounted charge) at the large car park just outside of town and either walk (15 minutes) or take the free shuttle that lets you right at the plaza where the hotel is located.""";Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

We had an extra bed for our child but our room was still spacious. We didnt have a room with a view of harbour/square but loved our balcony overlooking Piran's terracotta rooftops and the clock tower.We chose Hotel Tartini based on its Trip Advisor reviews and certainly weren't disappointed.If I am being really picky we didnt rate the breakfast particularly highly, but loved the roof-top terrace bar.I hope some day we will return to Piran and if we do we'd book into Hotel Tartini without hesitation.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Great place and location;5;24.08.2013;Tartini's personnel made our three night stay memorable. Hotel has a great location as it is right on the main square, just next to the small harbour. In comparison to other places you can arrive by car (just let the parking guy at the barrier know you have a reservation at Tartini hotel and he lets you enter the Old city for one hour free of charge) and unload your luggage directly at the hotel. Then you need to drive back to the parking lot on the hill (Fornace - 10 min walk) as this is the only place where you can leave your car. Our apartment had a large terrace which offered a beautiful view of both Tartini square and the sea. Room was airconditioned, nice and clean. When planning your stay in summer, check out their special offers. We booked our room with one day trip to Venice. It was very well organised in all aspects. For dinning at the hotel Tartini, you can choose the more casual Taverna directly on the square or for gourmet the Altana hotel restaurant. You can also use the option of having the dinner at the deck on the roof to make it romantic. Overall, this is a great place with helpful staff. Definitely can only recommend.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

Rooms are comfortable with quirky furniture and efficient air conditioning. Good breakfast. Bar downstairs with rooftop terrace upstairs. The terrace wasn't open yet when we were there - they said it was too cold still (it was early June and only 90F) but we could buy a drink downstairs and take it upstairs for fabulous views of the town square where a concert was occurring, the harbor and the sunset.

Probably the best quality and atmosphere for the price in Piran;5;26.07.2013;With my friends (a couple about 60s), on their way home from Dalmatia to Tirol, we decided to meet for a couple of days in Piran. They instantly fell in love with the town, its lively but easy going atmosphere, cute Tartini square - and the hotel / its location played important role as the square lied just below our room windows, drinking morning coffee at the hotel's bar on the square was a chance to enjoy the waking of the city, and evening drink at the bar on top of the hotel enjoying stunning views of the square, church and the harbour. As mentioned in other reviews, the staff are really kind and helpful, in our case allowed us to park bikes inside the hotel, borrowed us a chain to lock them, helping us to find a local provider of goat cheese in a village nearby, and called us when they found glasses I have forgoten in the room :) Piran is quite strictly closed for car traffic, but as guests of the hotel we enjoyed to have access to the hotel with the car (at arrival and departure), free entrance to the city with a car (which otherwise costs 5€ each time, not including parking) and reduced price of parking in a garage on the edge of the town (from 17€ to 7,5€ per day). There is a free and regular shuttle bus from the garage along the harbour to the hotel. As our activities included also some daily travelling with a car, it was great to be able to use a special, a bit complicated, but helpul system regarding the parking in the garage, involving several arrivals/departures while keeping the reduced daily tarrif for the parking.The only not so positive experience was the evening service on the terrace bar on top of the hotel - luckily we enjoyed the view, and had a lot to chat about... took ages to notice us, then to bring the ordered, and then we needed to finish our drinks quickly because the bar was closing. We realized the reason was there was only one waiter, teaching the other the bussiness, and both needed to climb steep steps from the bar to two terraces with the guests... But as mentioned, this did not spoil our assessment of excellent relation between the price and the hotel experience - it is probably the best you can get for the price in Piran today.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Perfect Piran;4;26.07.2013;We stayed in Hotel Tartini, which overlooks the main square (also Tartini) in delightful Piran. This is a little harbour town, extremely Italian in appearance and feel, but with a character all its own. Hotel Tartini is extremely comfortable with, some would say retro furniture, but I would say quirky. The staff are extremely nice and the breakfast is a knockout, served in a pleasant dining room with an outside terrace. There is also a rooftop bar, with a garden above that and a smaller rooftop perch seating about twelve people which overllooks the whole of Piran. Piran is very lively indeed and on one night we didn't know whether to choose the classical recital, the blues concert or a film shown in the gardens of the church. I would highly recommend both Piran and the hotel. A real discovery!;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

The double was a bit small, but also with a terrace - overlooking the port. The restaurant is a very spacious room with high ceilings and glass walls looking out on the seaward side. There is also a terrace. A nice place to take breakfast, which was a really good selection of hot and cold food and excellent coffee. We ate supper at the restaurant (on the square) only once. It too was really good and very reasonably priced. The best thing about Tartini is the staff. They are a very friendly, very helpful, very smiley bunch. We would definitely stay again.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
So many good points and...;4;12.07.2013;Piran is an ideal sea side area with the fishing boats, town square, cafes along the harbour and lovely resteraunts dotted around the town all offering the freshest of seafood meals. In a prime position on the edge of the town square and looking over the water or the hills if you have a back room is the Hotel Tartini. Entrance is a corridor between the shops which has to be undertaken in a great rush as there is nowhere to park outside or near the hotel. You can stop for long enough to unload in the bus stop. The bus takes you to the carpark and a reduced price ticket is available for parking once you check in.The hotel puts you in mind of a lighthouse the way it is shaped internally, always spiralling through each stair case. The rooms are basic but satisfactory. Air conditioning is available but does not have much impact. The balcony window offers a better alternative to the hot nights. Showers hot and steady.We were met by a young lady who was new and she was terrific, polite, helpful and eager to please. This proved to be the case for all the staff we encountered over our stay. Breakfast was plentiful and fresh.The hotel is so well positioned and offers so much potential it is an obvious place for a complete refurbishment to bring it up to the standard it should be. All the elements are there just needs a good spruce.We will be returning Piran was such a relaxing out of the way place;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
central location offering a room with a view;4;5.07.2013;This hotel offers a fine value for money in terms of location, room and service. If you're traveling by auto, be sure to have your reservation printed out and handy. Tell the gate keeper [access to this peninsula city is restricted] you're checking into the Hotel Tartini - he'll instruct you to take a ticket and drive in. Follow the shore line road to the main square and pull into the bus stop there but leave room for the bus to pass by. It's large enough for you to park short term so you can get your luggage over to the hotel and check in. The hotel will give you the necessary tickets to get you back out of the city and into the parking ramp at the hotel's 50% discount rate. The rooms are small but manageable. Bathroom is standard European - similar to those in any EU Med country... and perhaps cleaner than most. The best feature of our 5th floor room was the small, narrow balcony with chairs, which afforded us a wonderful view of the harbor and beyond into the sea.Breakfast was well stocked and very well maintained by a cheerful hostess, and dining outdoors was a treat. Front desk staff were cheerful and helpful. We did not try the next door taverna run by the hotel. We did have lunch at Pirat down the street 100m back toward the parking lot. The daily fish platter for two was excellent and you can sit outside on the large patio. Service was extremely friendly and the price/value outstanding compared to the fancy tourist places down on the esplanade.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
3 day stay July 2013;5;4.07.2013;"Excellent location and an interesting place to stay. It looks like a Venetian terraced house from the outside, but the interior is contemporary, light, and hung with interesting local art. We had a large room - three of us sharing but loads of space including a little ante-room, plus a large bathroom. We were at the back of the hotel with a balcony and an attractive view over tiled rooftops etc - looking over Tartini Square is probably prettier but would be noisy. The town wakes up early so you need to choose between open windows and early morning noise or air con and double-glazed silence.Lots of outdoor places to sit - terraces on 3 levels.Avoid the \cocktail\"" bar - the bartender doesn't know what he's doing and the resuts are fairly horrible! Stick to wines, beer, straightforward spirits.Great breakfasts. nice staff.""";Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

Extremely friendly service, perfect location!;5;18.06.2013;I use to come to Hotel Tartini for weekends with my husband since several years. This time I travelled with my mother. The location is perfect. Everything is in walking distance. Piran seen from Hotel Tartini is even more charming than it normally is.The rooms are not big, but the beds are comfortable and the bathroom has all the necessary facilities and the view is great!The car stays in a big garage outside the center of Piran. (You can enter Piran center only for delivering your luggage, then you have to go to the parking outside. There is a free bus transfer between center and parking.) The busstop is just in front of Hotel Tartini. For the parking you get a special hotel fee.Breakfast is very nice: there is a good selection of fruits, cereals, ham, cheese, teas, bread, ...What is most impressing is the extremly friendly and helping service. People at the reception are very supporting. Here an example: The day we left I must have been a little bit absent minded. We checked out and went by bus to the garage. There I recognized that I left the key of the car in the hotel. I phoned, the receptionist - a very nice woman - checked the room, found the key and brought it to me to the bus. Back home in Austria I found out that I had left a dress, which is important for me, in the cupboard. I phoned again, the receptionist promised to look for the dress. They found it and sent it without any paying from Piran to Vienna. THANK YOU!;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Hotel Tartini - charming and excellent;5;13.06.2013;Hotel Tartini is in a central location just of the main piazza, or Trg Tartini , in the old city, overlooking the harbour and the sea. It is uniquely designed in a rather funky style, with really good art works all over the walls. We were particularly impressed by the service, and are very grateful especially to Gregor, who among other helpful things, arranged a trip by car to Porec in Croatia, when we discovered that there were no buses at all.Piran is a gorgeous place to stay and Hotel Tartini is the place to stay while you are there.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
If you want to say in Piran, then worth considering...;4;10.06.2013;Piran is a lovely town (village) but with limited hotel options, due to the physical constraints of the old town. More mainstream hotels are located around the peninsula at Portaroz.But if you are looking for a place in the old town (which I highly recommend) then this or the Hotel Piran are your best choices for quality.It is an odd hotel in layout and design. Rooms are extremely small. Decor is eclectic at best, dated retro at worst. Amenities are limited, and breakfast, while offering wide choice, is average. Front line staff are polite at best. David (owner or manager, not sure..) is most helpful but is there to make a dollar (nothing wrong with that, just bear it in mind). But location is perfect and view from the roof top terrace is the best in Piran. With a price of just over EUR 100, it is value for money as well - just expect no frills.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Hotel Tartini;4;4.06.2013;The Hotel Tartini has an excellent location in the centre of the pretty main square. It is about 5 minutes walk from the Bus Station and overlooks the sea and harbour. The Staff are excellent and all speak very good English - special thanks to David on Reception with the great sense of humour, and the lovely mature lady in the Breakfast Room.

Great Views;4;30.05.2013;This hotel is well located in the main square. Parking is an issue but you get a ticket on entering the town which allows you to pull up near the hotel, unload your luggage and return to park in the multi storey garage near the entrance to the town. As traffic is limited in the centre it is a wonderfully quiet environment.The hotel is clean and well maintained. The rooms are cosy but not tiny although furniture is a little quirky and so somewhat dated. Some of the electrical facilities in the rooms could do with some attention.There is a wonderful terrace atop the roof which provides a commanding view of the square below and the adjacent harbour perfect for an early evening drink.The staff are very helpful especially Gregor who provided all the information that we asked for.

We had a room with a balcony and view of the water but some rooms face the square. There are a variety of restaurants within walking distance. We went up the narrow alleys to the church where lovely views awaited. The rooms are clean and in good repair if decorated a little funkily. Ours was on the small side but others are more spacious.

A Special Place;5;25.05.2013;We spent two nights at the Hotel Tartini, and were very pleased with the experience. The location is what really makes this hotel stand out....it's in the heart of a beautiful, pedestrian-only city. We booked a sea-view room with a balcony, and enjoyed looking out at the harbor. We also enjoyed sitting at the hotel's outdoor cafe, right on the main square. The staff was very friendly, in particular David, who helped us on several occasions.

Great location;4;21.05.2013;The hotel is right at the city square. The sea front is a stones throw away. Our rooms faced the square, not did not have any sea view. The rooms were reasonably sized and comfortable. Breakfast spread really good with a large choice. Visitors cars to city of Piran have to be left at the parking lot outside the city, but there are free shuttle busses every 15 minutes. the ride takes 5 minutes.

Excellent value for money;4;8.01.2013;Spent a long weekend here, and thought it was excellent value for money. Got the room that overlooked the harbour, which had a small balcony - not the biggest room, but bigger than a lot of other European hotels. Staff were friendly, especially the proprietor, who had lots of advice. Location is great - everywhere in this little medieval town is in walking distance from the hotel! The biggest drawcard is the value for money - in my opinion, one of the best value hotels I've stayed in. Nothing fancy, but you get really good value for what you pay.

Two nights in Hotel Tartini;5;10.12.2012;My teenage son and I spent some time exploring Slovenia,(Europe's best kept secret) in October, 2012. We spent two nights in the Hotel Tartini. The hotel is situated right on the main square of Piran and the town of Piran itself is very scenic and photogenic. Hotel Tartini treated us great. The staff at the front desk were exceptionally friendly and very eager to make our stay in the area a pleasant one. Vladi gave us some outstanding recommendations for dinner and for some daytime excursions in the area. Our room was clean and the view of the harbor from our porch was very nice. There is no parking in Piran save the parking garage accessed by shuttle bus, but the hotel can accommodate guests driving up to the front door for pick up and drop off. A must do for any visiting photographer: get up to the top of the city wall as the sun comes up in the early morning hours. You will be treated to a breathtaking shot of the city and the Adriatic surrounding it.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Great location but basic accommodations;3;8.11.2012;After driving around for over an hour looking for this hotel, a nice policeman finally walked along side our car to the main plaza. It was sort of sitting in plain sight, but this town is very difficult to navigate by car. The room itself was funky, but it was sparsely furnished and supplied. I think we paid for the great location because the hotel was sorta budget quality by American standards. Plus, it was at least a 15 minute walk from the parking garage. There is a shuttle so that helps. BTW the hotel staff recommends that you do not use a GPS because that will get you even more lost. Make sure that you have very specific instructions from the hotel.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Not the best with children..;3;30.10.2012;Good things first:Staff very friendly and helpful. Location great...if you don't mind the shuttle bus and parking far away. With a child and thousand things to carry it becomes a bit of a hustle. Room: Smelly, small, smelly and you should save the money for the sea view, cause you only get a glimps of it, at least in the room we had. Lamps next to the bed not working. Remote control of the TV not working. Big stains on the carpet. Have i mentioned it was smelly?We needed an extra bed for our child. I think the mattress of the bed hasn't been washed since the hotel was opened many years ago. Well there are a few things location and friendly staff can't make up for.

Friendly;3;10.10.2012;Hotel Tartini is in an excellent position in Piran. The main entrance to the hotel is off a lovely square where there is outdoor seating to the many cafes/bars. The side entrance is straight out onto the harbour. The staff are friendly and speak very good English. The hotel is clean but a little bit of maiinentance wouldn't go amiss. We had a suite of rooms with a lovely roof terrace but unfortunately, when it came round to bathing, niether the bath nor the shower over the bath worked. We were offered another ensuite bedroom but that meant carrying cases up a very steep flight of steps as the lift didn't go to the top floor. As it happened, we had to take a shower in one of those ensuites anyway as our bathing facilities couldn't be repaired. On checkout we were offered a 10 euro discount! Piran itself is a lovely coastal area of Slovenia but be warned - cars are only permitted to enter through a paying barrier but if you are staying there you get a parking permit for 6 euros for a carpark on the outskirts of the town. You then either walk to your hotel - about 15 mins or take the courtesy bus when it eventually arrives.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Piran and the Hotel Tartini Just Go Together;4;7.10.2012;We were at the Tartini for 3 nights and wished we could have stayed longer. When we first checked into room 307, I was surprised by how small it was, and concerned if we would be comfortable there. Once we unpacked and settled in it was amazing how we altered our feelings about the room--it was tight, but the ability to keep our balcony doors open extended the sense of space. There is a huge wardrobe with storage for all our things, and under and over storage for our suitcases. We were glad not to have to live out of the suitcases and get them out of the way. We had a large balcony with 2 chairs. (We do think they need to add a small table, but didn't ask.) The view of the harbor was nice, and sitting on the balcony we could look down on the terrace. The balconies on the 4th floor are smaller than those on the 3rd. Our bathroom was quite large. The room was very cleanNoise was never a problem for us--not from outside and not from other rooms. We found the breakfasts okay and they seemed to dole out some of the items. The woman who did most of the work in the breakfast room was most obliging when asked to replenish an item. The outdoor cafe was a delight and staffed by people who really want to make your time with them pleasant. The location right on the square made you a part of the city. There are markets just a couple of blocks away. It was easy to walk the entire town from such a central location.We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and were glad we stayed in Piran. It had a different feel at night when the day tourists are gone. Being in the Hotel Tartini made us feel like one of the locals. .;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Great location nice hotel;5;7.10.2012;We stayed here for 2 days at the end of a 10 day holiday touring around Slovenia. We drove in to the centre of town dropped our bags at the hotel and then parked the car in a small multi storey located about 1/2 a mile away for the hotel. Piran is a lovely little seaside town with wonderful Venetian buildings and a good choice of restaurants/bars to relax in. We ate in one of the sea front restaurants and were pleasantly surprised at the price. We paid 35 euros for 3 courses and 1/2 a litre of house wine. The hotel was spotlessly clean and the reception staff were really helpful. Breakfast was very nice and the restaurant is very smart and relaxing to eat in. We stayed in one of the rooms that overlooked the square but never had a problem sleeping as the room had double windows to keep the noise out. Wold definitely stay here again if we ever find ourselves back in lovely little Piran.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

The view from our room of the harbour and the sea was great. I regret we didn't have time for a coffee up on the rooftop terrace.I thought the 70's Italian style furniture in our room was interesting, a change from the austere Ikea-like IBIS hotel furniture which I have seen too much of lately. I wish we could have stayed longer but JAT airlines cancelled a flight and so we had to cut short our stay. The receptionists were also helpful for our journey back to LJU.Piran is special and the hotel is also and I am pleased to recommend this hotel.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

I worried at first about noise from the square, which perhaps could be a problem at some times of the year, but generally the square becomes quite quiet by about 11 pm. I spent 6 nights there without any issues from it. There was some construction nearby that caused some noise and for some reason was started before the sun came up, but that is not the hotel's fault. The staff was very friendly, and the breakfasts were good. There is a nice rooftop terrace that can give you a view of the port and Tartini square.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

Services are excellent and the staff is welcoming (many languages spoken). But the building is overdated in many ways : the window didn't shut down, the water in the shower was cold and an important noise resounds in the waterpipes when the neighbor use the sink !

Great location, a bit outdated and overpriced with great staff;3;19.09.2012;Stayed there for 4 days and have to say location is perfect, couldn't ask for better.Pros- location, amazing staff, especially Branka from restaurant, not busyCons- outdated and some areas need repair, like mold in bathrooms. Shower hardly drains so you are standing in a pool of dirty water. Sewage smell in bathrooms in room and hotel. Our first room (312 I think) was like a cleaning closet. Bed was rock hard, entry door broken, graffiti all over room scratched, a lot of damage. We asked to change room as we did not feel comfortable in a room where you can't even use the front door and sleep on a bed with no mattress it seems. We got a much better room on the 4th floor. Staff seemed very shocked about the condition of the room, strange as someone should have seen the Obvious damage and graffiti if it was ever cleaned.Overall good place and can't say enough about good staff, a bit overpriced for what it is.other notes- the bell tower can get very annoying and parking is a process, non of which have anything to do with hotel. Hotel provides discounted posting and there is shuttle to get to and from.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Views of the Adriatic, quaint location, great beds.;5;17.09.2012;This was my 2nd visit to Hotel Tartini. We were a group of 3 rooms. Our room was not as big as the others, but it overlooked Tartini Square and the church which was a plus for me. The other two rooms were larger and had a balcony. I prefer the view and watching the activity outside. Once the shutters are closed it is very quiet for sleeping. Our rooms had A/C and a mini-fridge. Beds were especially comfortable.I love the central location and historical building. It was nice to be able to park our van in front of the hotel to unload/load our luggage. (No cars are allowed here normally.)Although we did not eat dinner in Piran (we had a prst and Teran tasting earlier in Stanjel) the breakfast was especially plentiful, lots of fresh fruit, beautifully displayed and enjoyable to eat inside or outside. Lovely waitress, Svetlana, in the dining room was very bubbly and helpful. There is a rooftop bar with amazing church, square and sea views. There is also a pleasant bar in front of the hotel to people watch and take in the activities in Tartini Square. Free Internet in the lobby. Violin theme throughout the hotel incuding the room key!The hotel was clean and the front desk gal was really funny. (Later in our trip she did us a huge favor as one of our group left something there and she returned it to us in another city.)Just a few steps away, we could swim in the Adriatic and return to our hotel to shower. Super! Enjoyable one night. We shall return. Piran is just so darn cute!;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Great views and friendly staff;4;16.09.2012;We stayed at Hotel Tartini in September during a spectacular electrical storm happening more or less overhead in Piran. First night's sleep was a bit difficult because of this - nothing to do with the hotel - but slept well on the second night. We didn't experience any noise from Tartini Square as described by other reviewers as any musicians would have been incredibly brave on our first night and a bit windswept on the second! Rooms are just the right side of snug, as you would expect from such a central and historical building, and quirky. Beds comfortable. Shower was good but regularly fell from its cradle - not a problem when you got the balance right. People in neighbouring room left their shutter to fly open in the wind and continually bang against the balcony, which the staff sorted for us (thanks). Breakfast was great and the best we had during our time in Slovenia. Varied, fresh, and great coffee. Praise goes to the friendly lady at breakfast who was extremely helpful and incredibly sweet. Every hotel should have someone like her.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Nice accomodation in Piran;4;4.09.2012;We had a good stay at the Hotel Tartini in Piran during a quick overnight in between arriving on the boat from Croatia and picking up a rental car in Portoroz the next day. The hotel was clean and the front desk could not have been more helpful. The girl working the front desk sent us to the best pizzareia for dinner. It was amazing. I would also recommend stopping by the shop Piranske Soline which is just across the main square for a souvenir of Slovenian sea salt.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

What a view!;5;31.08.2012;The Hotel Tartini is great. Tartinijev trg 15 (http://www.hotel-tartini-piran.com/en) €82/night It had some so-so reviews but maybe they were before it was renovated because this place was wonderful. Of course the setting is the main thing – front rooms overlooking that gorgeous main square, back rooms get a view of the harbor. But it’s clean, modern inside, nice pink/salmon color outside. My single room was plenty large, comfy bed, great AC, mini fridge, free wi-fi. Can’t think of anything that’s missing. Furnishings all very new. And there’s live music outside from about 8pm (course it was weekend in midsummer, don’t think this probably happens every day, but what a treat. First a jazz band with decent vocalist, then a drumming group, next night another singing group). The hotel breakfast was one of the best I’ve ever had – fresh pineapple, cantaloupe, watermelon, lots of bread and croissant and cake choices, meats, cheeses, eggs, vegetables, etc.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

Have stayed here twice and it continued to get worse;2;19.08.2012;"The hotel is very run down, over priced, carpets have holes in them, the heating did not work properly and the noise level was too much in the late evening. The second time we stayed there in Spring 2010, it was a cold spring and their heating didn’t work and an extra blanket was not available; just put on an extra pair of sweats for sleeping. It's in a nice location, but the wear and tear is showing. They do have wi-fi, but it's hit or miss when it is working. The staff sort of shrugs their shoulders when asking them about wi-fi. The noise throughout the hotel was fairly high late at night. The first time we stayed (2005) we could see a slice of the harbor and it was an average hotel, good enough for our pleasure traveling and only staying 2 nites. However, this last trip back (Spring 2010) while on business, everything was really looking ragged around the edges. Food was average for breakfast. The good thing is its location, you are right on Tartini square and walking distance of restaurants, churches, cafes, stores and the harbor.

enjoyable & friendly - a place with flair!;4;19.08.2012;"Extremly nice place in the centre of Piran. Helpful staff, good breakfast, beautiful terrace on top with great view... if you want to spend some days in a very nice town where you have both: the flair of ancient venice and the possibility to swim and sunbath, you will enjoy Piran. Cars are not allowed but you won't need your car, if you want to get around. Very good restaurants in town and at the seaside... beaches with cafés but no disco stress ;-) all can be reached from Hotel Tartini by foot within a few minutes... Of course there are tourists, but no party people...the town is easy-going and enjoyable for people of all age...

A bit dated but a nice location;4;13.08.2012;"The hotel was easy to find based on instructions received upon booking. It is necessary to obtain a pass to drive into the old town to drop luggage and check in. The staff was very helpful in explaining the parking process.The rooms were generally clean even though the decor is a bit dated. The paint could use some touch-up as there were marks on the bright yellow walls and I recommend a little carpet cleaning or, better yet, replace the carpet with wood. The bathroom was clearly old based on the color selection of the tiles; however, it was so clean that the age was not an issue.The hotel is located right on the main square, across from the harbor and three minutes from the promenade along the sea with the tourist restaurants and ocean access.The staff was helpful, courteous and personable. Breakfast seemed a bit disorganized although the selections were plentiful.I would likely try one of the other hotels in the old town for a future stay, but I know there are not many choices. I would not recommend against staying here as long as you do not expect a clear view too the sea or a recently updated room.";Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Great location;4;10.08.2012;We booked this hotel for 1 night driving through on the way to Croatia. There is no driving in Piran, so you have to leave the car at the city entry in the parking lot. If you are a guest of the hotel you pay for a night 6 euro instead of 15. Downside is that you have to walk 50 meters downhill to the free bus shuttle taking you to the hotel. In the hotel they specifically told us that the bus parks right at the parking which is not true, and we had to carry all our heavy luggage down the stairs and 50 meters in burning heat ... not fun ... When I complained in the hotel, they said I could have driven in and unload my bags at the hotel and than park... now they tell me... asked for a wake up call and they forgot to call me, as an excuse they said that the girl was a student and didn't write it down for the next shift ...rooms were okay, air-condition was very needed and worked well.

The rooms are simple and without much additional equipment. The breakfast is very simple.Free wireless Internet throughout the hotel, just remember to ask for code! Rooms with sea view was not worth the money, in front of the window there was a massive railing on the terrace so you had to get out on the terrace and lean over the railing to get a glimpse of the sea. Had to park outside the city itself, but it was free shuttle bus every 5 minutes. Was allowed to run in to set and retrieve baggage. The city is not car-free as we thought in advance, there is a lot of cars, unsure of who is allowed to park in the city? A tip: go to church, pay 1 Euro, and go up the steps in the tower.

Great staff, but otherwise unexceptional;3;11.06.2012;We stayed here as part of a small group. The manager / owner is an exceedingly pleasant person, and the rest of the staff are great (especially the woman who works the breakfast room). Right out the front door is Tartini Square, so you are at the heart of the city. There is a common balcony for great city views. Some rooms open to the square, and ours was away from the square but had a small balcony. The rooms are functional but unexceptional. They could use some refurbishing, and the carpeting was either very old or needed a really good cleaning. Keep in mind that if you get a room facing the square, you get noise with a view. On the Thursday night we were there, there was music in the square until 2:00am. We didn't hear it in our room, but someone in our small group did. Also, there are some vehicle restrictions you should look into before you get there if you drive, as it is in the pedestrian zone.

If you like rooms that have enough space to walk around in, comfortably access to your luggage, easy access to power outlets, closets that don't impinge on your bed, lamps that work, and reliable internet connections, then look elsewhere. The staff is quite helpful most of the time and the breakfast buffet is okay, but there is nothing about this hotel that is outstanding except its location smack on the main square of Piran. I give them points for trying but they have a ways to go, which is surprising in a major tourist area where the competition must be fierce.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Not as good as expected;3;9.08.2011;The position on the square sounds good, anyway, but it means a lot of noise at night until the early hours, especially from minibuses that constantly ferry people into and out of the centre and wait on the corner with their engines running. The furniture's tired - I suppose the same as it was before the fall of the Berlin Wall. Breakfast was disappointing, to me anyway. On the plus side, it is in the centre, so you haven't got much walking to do, and the front desk staff can be helpful.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
A Quirky but Good Choice in Piran;4;9.08.2011;"The hotel's location is great - right on the main square, and also next to the harbor/Adriatic. Make sure to have a sunset drink at the rooftop bar; we really enjoyed people watching at the square as well as over the sea. The rooms are a bit quirky and run down, and don't have lots of conveniences, but the sea view ones our party had included nice little balconies. The included breakfast buffet was nothing special but was adequate. Take advantage of the valet parking - the 5 euro saves at least half an hour if not more of hassle with the parking outside of town. There aren't a lot of choices in Piran, and we debated between Tartini and Hotel Piran right on the sea boardwalk. After staying at Hotel Tartini and looking at the competition, I think we made the right choice.";Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Centre of town - perfect.;4;29.07.2011;"There is a multi-story parking structure as you drive into Piran. You need to park here, then either walk into town, or take the free shuttle bus from the ground floor. The shuttle bus drops you virtually outside the door of Hotel Tartini. The front desk will charge you EUR 6 for a parking ticket to get out of the car park - cheaper than paying at the car park. I think they also have a valet parking system, but we had rented a stupidly large van, so we could/did not use it.The hotel says \Guests can drive with their car undisturbed to the hotel on the Tartini square. You can leave the vehicle for a short moment near the hotel at the entrance to the Tartini square.\"" But we were stopped at the entrance to the town and told to go back to the car park. Perhaps if we had confirmed reservation it would have been different.Our rooms had a sort of view of the water, but we weren't in the room that much. And there is a deck where you can relax and soak in the view.There is Free wifi in the hotel, but BEWARE. You only get one hour of free wifi per computer - I'm not sure if the clock starts ticking when you first log on or if it remembers when you log out.The bathroom shower had a cheapish feel to it, but nothing to worry about.The town is cute. We were told to avoid the seafood restaurants on the south side of the peninsular. However, the food looked fine, and we ate at one of the restaurants further along the street. We weren't cajoled to come in - a marketing gimmick we hate - the food was pretty good. I had fish, and the others had pasta with truffles which they said was excellent. The service was very good - no, superb - enough attention without being in the way.""";Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

Very comfortable, great location, with charming touches;4;22.06.2011;So, the hotel was a surprise, booked by an aunt for us, so we wouldn't have to crowd into her place and crash on the floor, so we didn't choose it. It was very pleasant - our room was on the 3rd floor, with big french doors and a terrace overlooking the harbor. The place had a marvelous terrace on the roof, which you could take breakfast up to and look out over the town (in high season, it was probably used specifically for that, but we were there in the off season, plus they were doing a lot of construction, so breakfast took place in the main dining room downstairs).I have to say that, while the hotel overall was quaint, the room itself was kind of an 80s arthouse nightmare: garish colors, deliberately bizarrely shaped and angled furniture and shelves. Ugh. Big clash with the lovely exterior, and big shuttered windows. That aside, the room was clean and comfy, spacious, and right in the center of town - easy walk to anything.No real complaints: a cozy stay in a lovely area. Not a knockout or anything, but definitely not uncomfortable at all.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Great Location, but not a good value;3;29.05.2011;I enjoyed this hotel. I have even stayed here on two different occasions. BUT... no wifi, no outlets in the bathroom, only one outlet in the bedroom, and uncomfortable beds make for a less than ideal stay. The people are incredibly nice and the breakfast is top notch, but the price is high for a hotel that is a bit run-down. I also would like to have received an email upon booking to explain how to get to the hotel to drop off bags and what the parking situation is like (a garage about 1 mile away with a free shuttle bus to take you there and away). Plus, the charge for having a pet in the room is much higher than any other hotel I have stayed at in Europe (plus, it seems to have increased since September when I last stayed there).;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

Elegant and sophisticated;5;31.08.2010;I have travelled to Piran for many years and this year decided to give Hotel Tartini another visit. I was not disappointed as it still retains its elegant and sophisticated style, even if some of the edges are looking a little frayed. I suspect the hotel needs a little attention to detail but the overall picture is one of comfort in a superb location in the heart of this magical and historical port. Rooms are spacious enough and are simply furnished in1980's style which was when this hotel undertook major rennovation. The only change is that the rooftop pool has been replaced with an outdoor bar / cafe. This is topped again with an intimate crows nest overlooking the central square and harbour - best enjoyed in late evening with a glass or two ..... Breakfast is excellent offering a wide range of hot and cold choices from the buffet.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
good location... but overpriced;2;19.08.2010;My wife and I stayed in the hotel Tartini with our two children. The city of Piran is beautiful and the hotel is perfectly located to explore it. The rooms however were very basic. We had two, and the shower did not work properly in either. It was rather cramped and run down. All this would have been alright were it not for the fact that the Hotel Tartini is charging prices as it were a luxury hotel... and it is not. We stayed the night before in the Hotel Excelsior Savoy in Trieste. It cost less and was infinatley nicer.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Excellent Location;4;15.08.2010;I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights on a recent visit to Slovenia and was very pleased with the accommodation. The location could not have been better - just on the square. We arrived from Ljubljana by bus and the walk from the station only took 7 minutes. The front desk staff were very friendly and accommodating and even helped us with bus and train timetables for our journey to Venice when we discoverded that the Wednesday ferry had been cancelled. Breakfast was excellent with the usual selection of juices, cereals, fruit, hot and cold food etc. I agree with a previous review that mentioned the friendly, smiling lady in the breakfast room who was more than willing to provide assistance if needed. On the day of our departure we had to leave the hotel before breakfast but were provided with a packed lunch. The room was clean and had air conditioning and a mini bar. Soap dispensers on the wall were the only toiletries provided. There was no tea making facility in the room. A safety box was provided free of charge at reception. The only negative about the location was the ringing of the church bell 4 times every hour. I had difficulty sleeping at night because of this. This is by no means a fault of the hotel but it is something to consider if booking the accommodation.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

This saves driving through into town and you cannot park outside the hotel and its not easy to park else where.Hotel good nice breakfast .The reception area is not too good but it is an old building.Nice rooftop bar attached to the hotel .Most things close up about midnight so no problem with noise.Would reccommend and stay again.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

Primo Location, Mediocre Accomodation;3;30.05.2010;Piran is a breathtaking little town. We loved our day there, and highly recommend a visit to anyone in the region.I had a difficult time selecting a hotel in Piran using TripAdvisor reviews -- a couple looked mediocre, and one (Max) was apparently run by an unreliable drunk. So I went with Hotel Tartini, with the expectation that limited quality and value would be remedied by a first-rate location. And that's what happened. My +/- review:Positives------------* Location -- Right on Tartini Trg, we were based on the far corner of one of Slovenia's most beautiful squares. Our room had a small balcony with a view of the water (see photo). Couldn't be beat.* Breakfast -- A very large spread, with lots of variety. Negatives--------------* Weak Value -- You pay for the location at 112E (and 50% off parking), but not much else. Room decoration was cheesy, and, like many reviewers, we had bathroom problems. Nothing warm or comforting about the place.* Broken Faucet Drain -- It was busted when we walked through the door. Coupled with the numerous other complaints about bathroom quality on TripAdvisor, it really made us wonder how the staff could have missed it.* Unhelpful Staff -- They treated us like we were a burden. While transactions were processed efficiently, no one seemed to care whether we were doing OK.Bottom line: If I had to do it again, I still might stay at Tartini, but would look elsewhere first. Primo location, but might be able to do better. . . .;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
great location, bad front-desk staff;3;4.01.2010;"The thing about Piran is, that cars aren`t allowed in the city center (you can park by your hotel for 30minutes only, just to take your stuff to the room and have to leave your car on the parking lot located, like, 500meters away). It`s charming that you can do your walking and sightseeing without being disturbed with vehicles, but, on the other hand, things can get pretty chaotic ever since you entered the main square. I remember messy manipulation with cards, papers and other legitimative material from the hotel which actually confirmed that you are a hotel guest and so you can park in the packed parking lot. we had trouble finding place, not to mention rudeness of the parking guard. The front-desk staff wasn`t any better either. The woman seemed to be enjoying her first day at job and kept telling us one sentence which she learnt in english- \i suggest you go park the car now and then you take the luggage upstairs\"". On every question my boyfriend had she answered the same...together with the parking-chaos outside, it didn`t give any good impression about the hotel.The building is well located directly in the city center by Tartini statue, looks nice from the front, inside it`s rather average. rooms were ok, but nothing special- i`ve seen much better in hotels of this cathegory. But the view and a little italian-style balcony was charming. So, don`t expect any wonders. I think there are better places to stay in Piran- try to rent a room by Campanilla or on the main street.""";Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Fabulous location... not so fabulous quality;2;8.05.2009;"When we arrived at Hotel Tartini, they did not have our reservation (via hotels.com), but told us we were \in luck\"" - they did have one room available, and they would even give it to us for 30% off... because there had been an a/c leak and the room had a moldy wall. As there were no other rooms available in the entire town, we begrudgingly accepted the mold room for our one night in Piran. The missing reservation was a human error on the part of the hotel staff, which they admitted but didn't seem particularly apologetic about.The room smelled musty but was OK once we aired it out. Moldy wall aside, the room's furnishings were somewhat tired and worn, and the bed made a ridiculous amount of noise, waking us up whenever one of us rolled over during the night. We were happy to be spending just one night there.The location is fabulous for wandering around this small seaside town, and the views from the rooms are quite nice.

Probably won't stay here again;2;17.09.2008;We chose Hotel Tartini because it was conveniently located for the ferry from Slovenia to Venice. The staff was nice, the price wasn't high, and, over all, the hotel is in reasonable condition. But our bathroom was not clean and our room wasn't air conditioned, so we had to keep our windows open all night, which made sleep impossible because of non-stop noise.

"Not cheap, but worth it for the location; quirky; friendly";4;11.09.2008;"This hotel fronts on to the main square in Piran and it's about a 10 minute walk from the bus terminus. The building is at least 2 hotels merged into one, with the original grand entrance into one now being the hotel restaurant. The lift is small and slow and really only used to move luggage (and presumably anyone who finds stairs difficult), at other times the stairs are best. Our room was at the end of a corridor, on the corner of the building, and probably larger and brighter as a result. It attracted a premium price 120 euros per night (room and breakfast) for the \sea view\"", which was in fact largely blocked out by the local museum. No complaint as the balcony was great and there were no overlooking windows. Furniture had character. Bathroom fittings showing their age, but usable.Buffet breakfast was provided. A bit short on some things, depended whether we coincided with deliveries from the kitchen. Otherwise no complaints. We were pleased with the evening meal (not part of the booking). Food was good and the homely babushka who served was super (17 euros with discount for hotel residents).Location was great, with easy access to old town, cathedral, walls, bathing, etc. There's a local supermarket for supplies just off the main coast road about 50yards from the hotel.

The triple room we had was a decent value, and was very large and clean. The bathroom definitely could benefit from some updating, but was still completely functional. We didn't notice any issues with mold or anything.The breakfast was okay, but not really anything special.The hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful. They gave good advice for restaurants and packed up a breakfast for us when we had to leave early our last morning. Parking in the municipal lot is included with the price of the room. Cars are only allowed into Piran for unloading, and they will tow your car if you leave it where you're not supposed to.

Stay here for the roof terrace!;4;8.07.2008;We liked this hotel, primarily for 2 reasons - the amazing roof terrace where they serve drinks from 6-12 and the friendly staff.

Pleasant enough;3;12.08.2007;The Tartini is an average hotel in a lovely location. However, getting to that location is not easy! If you have a car, you are only allowed to drive in to the town to drop off bags (and you need to pay via a ticket barrier to do this - that is if you can convince the gruff barrier staff to let you through!), then afterwards you have to park in a public car park 800 metres from the hotel.This is quite a hassle on arrival (especially after a long tiring journey) and would have been more acceptable if the hotel had made the whole process clearer on their website or in correspondence.In fairness to them they can't help the rules of driving/parking in the town, and they do give you a ticket to let you park in the somewhat distant car park for free.The desk staff were not particularly friendly at any time during our stay.Our room was very tired looking. On a positive note we had a balcony with harbour/sea view so we didn't have to stare at the dodgy furniture and the naff mini bar/fridge.The bathroom left a little to be desired. The shower was essentially a giant tap with no spray action whatsoever!The room had adequate air conditioning which meant you could close the doors at night to keep the noise out but stay cool.Breakfast was good with a decent selection, certainly not the worst we experienced in Slovenia!The highlight of the hotel is a lovely garden terrace/bar with the best view in town. The barman was amiable and attentive. Nobody else in the hotel seemed to know about this great feature which was fine by us!Overall I would say that the Tartini is adequate for a stay in the centre of Piran, just be aware of some of the downsides of the hotel before you book.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Shameful;1;7.02.2007;Probably the thing that makes us most angry about Piran is that it has all of the ingredients that should make it one of the region's finest towns. There is a lot of beautiful architecture, a charming little marina full of small working fishing boats, lovely views up to the surrounding hills and out across the bay... in fact everything you should ever want from a small Adriatic port. BUT:It appears that all of its citizens are content to let the city rest on its historical and architectural laurels, to the point where the poor thing is now suffering from laurel-sores. The hotels are grim in the extreme - especially this one. Having been 'upgraded' to a suite, we expected something rather special. Which is what we got: special fungus around the bath, special air conditioning fans outside the terrace, special curtains that wouldn't close and a special mini-bar, masquerading as a commercial drinks fridge, complete with lights and heavy-duty motor.Furthermore, all but two of the local restaurants take the word ordinary to new vistas, most of the shops sell tat and the whole place just reeks of quick bucks.Go and have a look, because it's very pretty, but sleep elsewhere.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

We were part of a 33 person Wisconsin and Toronto combined travel group and stayed at the hotel for seven days while doing day tours throughout Slovenia and down into Croatia.The staff was very accommodating and had a good command of the English language, They served a decent buffet breakfast in the morning. There are many good seafood restaurants along the esplanade which visitors should take advantage of.Room quality varies. Those with twin beds are more spacious and are located at the back of the hotel.

Curate's egg!;2;17.09.2006;Very cheerful staff let down by a total lack of management in all aspects of the hotel.Adequate breakfast but, for example, on entering the dining room at 8am it was difficult to find somewhere to sit. All the tables were strewn with the detritus of finished meals. No eggs-requested-then informed that the cook had 'gone out' and they didn't know where she was. That same night served fish for dinner which was grilled on one side and raw on the other.Scruffy staff and personal hygiene in doubt. 10 wash hand basin plugs to 43 rooms.

Quirky hotel;4;10.09.2006;My husband and I have just come back from 10 days at the Hotel Tartini in Piran. The hotel is very quirky, it takes a little while to get used to the quirkyness of the hotel. The rooms are fairly small but clean, we had a room on the 4th floor with a sea view which was nice but the balconies are smaller the higher up the building you go, (typical Venetian style). The breakfast is perfectly adequate, the usual supply of bread, fruit, yoghurts, etc the evening meals however are a little basic and would recommend you eat out at as there are lots of restaurants locally serving very good food.The hotel staff were friendly, there is no swimming pool however and if you're there to sunbathe this is a little difficult as there are only a handful of sun loungers to go around, having said that they do have a terrace looking over the town which has a really good vantage point of the town even though the terrace is a little rundown.Piran is a wonderful place - we would def go again and we would once again stay at the quirky hotel Tartini.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997

Pretty good.;4;12.08.2006;After having numerous bad/disappointing experiences at hotels throughout Europe, spending a couple of days at Tartini was like a breath of fresh air.Located right in the center of Piran, it's in short walking distance of everything. The room was air-conditioned, quite spacious and clean. The staff were friendly and helpful. Breakast was OK - nothing flash but good enough. We didn't have any other meals in the hotel as there are so many places to eat nearby.One negative - they charge (very cheap) for internet use in the lobby. Coming from Japan, this was something that annoyed me all over Europe.Anyway, if you're staying in Piran, there is absolutely nothing wrong with Hotel Tartini.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Hotel was interesting in an Eastern European way... what a trip!;4;1.08.2006;"First of all, I must say that Piran is a truly beautiful, picturesque medieval town! We arrived late night after driving over from Italy and wow -- what a view! We felt like we'd been transported back several hundred years.Our hotel was definitely quirky -- the decor was a weak attempt at post-modernism that came across more as unintentional kitsch. Still fun though! The staff was friendly enough. We had a \sea view\"" which was partially obscured by a building. The water pressure in the shower was surprisingly strong.If you are driving, heads up -- you will need to park just outside the town in a public lot and walk into town. Fortunately for us, this hotel is the closest to the parking lot.I don't think there are many options here for accommodations and even with the weirdness of this hotel, it still helped create a memorable experience. Go see Piran!""";Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
nice, in spite of the problems;1;14.05.2006;"This is the beste Haus am Platze, literally - a small-seeming but large hotel right on the main square. Piran is too charming for words, especially in nice weather. We had a wonderful stay here, but there are drawbacks with this house. The furniture is clearly not *** but *, the bathroom and floor are not clean (don't even THINK of using the toilet brush!), the beds extremely narrow, the TV tiny and almost b/w and with odd channels, the breakfast is absolutely lousy, and we had the unfortunate company of an American Alumni Tours group that, as usual, got so noisy at night that it made sleeping difficult. And yet, and yet... the place is great! I myself found the rooms to the square much more interesting than those to the sea (which are € 15 more), although only the tiny singles have a balcony. Some tips for Piran: Do try the touristy, French-style restaurants on the inner side for dinner at least once; they are fun, cheap, and they have very good seafood (a nice platter for two for € 30 and the excellent local Malvasia wine in liter carafes). The Theater Café is a great hangout, quite cool, good service, cheap drinks. In the morning, the nice cafés and bars on the outer side bask in the morning sun, and you can sit right at the sea.Logistics: If you have a car, you have to get a ticket when entering Piran (only from one side); the entire city is administered as a parking zone. One hour is free, then it adds up; overnight is € 23. So, you can drive in, unload your luggage, return to the exit, park there, and take the shuttle bus back. If you do find a parking space on the Tartini Square, my advice is to take it and pay up, if you are there for one or maybe two nights; it's worth the money to save the hassle. The hotel has three spaces in front, and if one is just empty (we had this luck), then just park there and don't leave.";Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Not quite what we expected;2;27.03.2006;We stayed one night in this hotel, and were not too impressed at all. We came by car and found that there was no place to stop the car outside of the hotel to unload our bags (despite communicating with the hotel that we were coming by car) and then that we had to park 800m away and take a shuttle bus with our bags (which was full and so we ended up walking). The room's decor was very tacky and overwhelming, but we did have a balcony with a sea view. Although the sea was only visible from a small portion of the view, it seemed a bit of a stretch to call that a sea view in my opinion. The balcony door was also very dodgy and we had a considerable time trying to open the door, and an even harder one closing it (it looked as if it had broken and had been cellotape-fixed) I agree with a previous reviewer concerning the hotel pool, it did not look inviting at all. Overall the hotel staff were helpful, the breakfast was not too great, but we were there during the off-season, so presumably it has a larger selection generally.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
Beautiful views;4;30.12.2005;Having booked a sea view in advance we were sent to a room which overlooked the square. The view was actually beautiful but we wanted to see the sea so got moved - the staff were a but curt but sorted the problem out quickly. The hotel is stylish and clean, maybe a little pricey but only when compared with hotels in less popular parts of Slovenia. The rooftop terrace is a big selling point over other hotels in the town - spectacular views, a nice sun-trap and a little pool to cool down in. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good place to stay in Piran, particularly in the summer months.;Hotel Tartini;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeHotelTartini;Tartinijev trg 15, Piran 6330, Slovenia;45.5280426;13.5682997
great location but rather disappointing hotel;2;29.10.2005;Piran well worth a visit for one night or so. Hotel is in great central setting overlooking a square. Hotel itself is (perhaps unsurprisingly) not that cheap for distinctly average accommodation. Style leaves something to be desired (doesnt really work, and Rough Guide billing over complementary in this respect in my view). Rooftop swimming pool a joke - clearly hadn't been open for a while and was a deep green colour. Otherwise staff pleasant and helpful. Harbour restaurants excellent and good value.

Expensive grandeur ;4;4.06.2017;"This hotel delivers at a price. Unless you are on the upper floors you may not see the sea as there is a road between the hotel and the sea . Single storey buildings shops/ restaurants etc occupy the space across from the hotel.So its the hotel garden ( v nice ) then the main road then the shops and the imported sand patch which is called the beach, the Adriatic being restrained by a low wall. The hotel offers a magnificent pool (sea water) of the inside/outside type and health spar. The restaurants and bars are very nice except for their top restaurant. The pomposity of the head waiter put us off straight away \ We do not do tap water \"" the food on the menu was described in a juvenile way \""Duck in the garden \"" turned out to be soup with duck slices .After a week of fish we thought we would be growing fins so we ordered steak 1hr and 1/4 later it arrived..... hmm a problem in the kitchen a real \""faulty towers experience \""!! To drink we ordered the Kempinsky special house Merlot a vile concoction not improved by the head waiters antics with an outlandishly shaped decanter.( 75 eu a bottle ) The staff are all very nice and the celebrated breakfast in the Crystal Room with its outdoor extension was a highlight. Beware the sea gulls they will take the fried egg off your plate if you leave the table for second.Our room was in the new extension, a disappointment the layout not much different from your average Novotel, adequate just.The A/C was poor we only found out you could get it fixed if you told the reception. A bottle of wine and an apology followed .In all we liked the hotel but wished we hadn't got the impression that it was a desperate money grabbing machine ( beer 3x more expensive than out side)if you wanted to \""push the boat out\"" champagne was the equivalent of L170 a bottle hmm.IvorSlee """;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

Outstanding Hotel;5;27.04.2017;Stayed here for a business meeting but will come back again with my family. The seafront location is perfect for Portoroz and the hotel is a great mix of modern luxury combined with a unique 110 year history. I enjoyed one of the best meals I have had in a very long time in the converted lobby of the original hotel surrounded by high wooden ceilings and ornate fireplace. I also loved the original leather armchairs in the bar which were restored from over 100 years ago and placed back in the bar. I know all of this because the best thing about the hotel was the staff who were extremely helpful at very point and were more than keen to share the history of the hotel. The facilities in the hotel were excellent and the newly built modern extension of the blends perfectly with the original building. I was told that July and August are very busy which is typical of most hotels on the Adriatic so would recommend a stay in May or June and would also recommend asking for a room with a sea view.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

More like 4 star hotel - too many mistakes;3;19.04.2017;"As much as it pains me to say it, the truth is that our stay at Kempinski Palace Hotel in Portorož was a big disappointment. It started badly already when I called the hotel prior to arrival as I wanted to order welcome fruit basket for one of the rooms. I was denied the service even though I mentioned that I'm happy to pay for it. Kempinski staff member dismissed me arrogantly with justification that this type of service is provided for special guests only and that I should call a room service when I arrive to the hotel. This was only the beginning of our worst 5 star hotel experience. Bathroom in my room was left with a DNA sample from the previous guest and the room wasn't tidied properly during the day. Used bathroom towels were not replaced and bed sheets looked like no one touched them at all. During the stay, hotel staff was nice and helpful although not all of them spoke Slovenian which can be quite upsetting for a Slovenian. Hotel managers should consider better quality outfit for their staff in a dining service. They looked more like Ryanair staff than Kempinski Luxury 5 star hotel ones.I could go on and on but on more positive note: breakfast is good and served until noon in a gorgeous dining room. Although outdoor pool is very small compering to the size of the hotel, it's clean and filled with the sea water. Bed is good and the room is quite. Expect nothing and you might end up happy with the stay. Expect Luxury and you'll end up with a disappointment.

Cons: I can compare to other Kempinski hotel and the quality was a bit lower than average. The pillows were not very comfortable but what I disliked the most was cold water in pool and 32 degrees in jacuzzi which was very cold to stay in... I love wellness and this hotel was total loser in wellness in my eyes. If you compare it to Kempinski High Tatras it's like 5star and 1star. The owner should do something about it. Of course also charge 26 EUR for 0,4l of fresh juice is also a bit extreme...;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

Great getaway.... but....;4;16.01.2017;Staff was super friendly. Breakfast (included) was delicious. Hotel was very clean and well kept. My only complaints (with the Rose Spa) were that the hot tub was barely luke warm, and the services I paid (a lot for), were a slight disappointment. I couldnt fully enjoy the massage as I was uncomfortable and some techniques used were a little painful. My underarm wax left me red and sensitive for a few days, which is not normal for me as this is something I do regularly. The pedicure was probably the worst part as the water I soaked my feet in wasn't warm, was only for a few minutes, and it was in a bucket. When she was working on my toes, the tools she used kept cutting me around the cuticles, later leaving my toes very red and swollen. I couldnt even get in the pool because the salt water was stinging my cuts. The spa could use a little more experience overall. The hotel itself was beautiful and in a great location.

A 4 star experience ;4;3.01.2017;It was my first time in Kempinski Palace. I have always admire the outside of a beautiful old Palace building. The room was nice and big enough. In a new building with balcony and partly sea view. I would recommend they change a hair conditioner provider. It was the worst I have ever tried. Even in a lower star hotels. But ok, that is not a con, it is only a suggestion. Breakfast is served in a magnificent hall and it has a lot to offer. My biggest disappointment was, that I did not get a proper espresso, but a filtered coffee in a espresso cup. Being a coffee lover, that was a big no-no. On the last day, my knife was dirty. Ok. It happens. I guess. The spa is very small and crowded. And one day the bubbles in a massage pool stopped working. My friend laid there for half an hour and nothing. And it was still two hours until closing time. The staff in general is very nice and polite! So. It was a lovely 4 star stay, if you get a great value deal, on booking maybe, you definitely shouldn't hesitate to take it!;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

First class service...;5;28.12.2016;...superb location, great food. Everything was according to the expectations and above except Spa and indoor swimming pool area where I saw a need for the slight facelift in the field of curtains, lighting, and details.Nice integration of the traditional and super modern architecture in the same hotel.

Beautiful Palace in a beach resort;5;12.11.2016;This is definitely best hotel in Slovenian Riviera PORTOROG. Kempinski offers luxury 5-star service but this was different.

Luxury on Slovenian coast.;5;9.11.2016;"Kempinski Palace Portorož was my second Kempinski after a stay at the High Tatras hotel in Slovakia. I jokingly say that Kempinski has ruined staying at the hotels for me - because even though I get to stay at nice hotels either for work or leisure, they rarely get better and more luxurious than Kempinski. I stayed at the Palace in Portorož for two nights on a business trip at the beginning of November 2016.The hotel itself is located on the main promenade, just a stone throw's from the Adriatic Sea. The original building was built in 1910 and reconstructed in 2008. The reconstruction added a modern annex with more rooms and an indoor swimming pool. The reconstruction was done in a very tasteful matter marrying the old with the new. I stayed in one of the \Traditional\"" rooms in the old part of the hotel. The room was very spacious and all the details were spot on, as one expects from establishment of this standing. However, the bathrooms are quite small and I prefer a big shower to small bathtub. The king-size beds were comfortable with luxurious bedding. The breakfast was definitely something to write home about - great choice and great quality of breads, fruit conserves and jams, teas, fruits and cereals. All served in a Crystal Hall that was nothing short of spectacular. However, It would be nice to have some more kinds of cheese and cold cut meats to choose from. The culinary creations that we were served for lunch and dinner were equally delicious, so I would recommend trying their restaurant as well. The hotel as a swimming pool and a spa. I did not have a chance to try the pool - as in the low seasons it opens late and closes early - so it did clash with my work schedule. Kempinski Palace Portorož is most likely the best hotel on Slovenian coast, a true gem and well worth the visit if you want to feel truly luxurious.""";Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Highs and Lows - Some Great Staff + Best Coffee in Slovenia;4;28.10.2016;Ok - I like to start on the positives:At breakfast try and find the waiter called Rok. He makes the most amazing coffee - the best in Slovenia. He looked after my wife and me so very well, we would have stayed another night because he made such an effort for us.And the F&B Manager, Pedro was superb. He knows how to manage his team and the guests.In the room the bed was first rate and the linens superb.Great views over the sea.My wife liked the gym.The location is great and you can easily get a bus into the old town - a short journey.The less good stuff:The shower randomly burns you and then freezes you. If my shower was that bad at home I would have it fixed immediately and there is no excuse for this in a major hotel.When we checked in we were told that breakfast is until 12:00. My wife and I both confirmed and reconfirmed this because it is so unusual and the receptionist kept confirming. The next day we went to breakfast at 11:00 and were told that breakfast had closed. One of the staff wanted to argue with me over why we were misinformed - all they needed to do was apologize but they wanted to correct me. That was a bummer.Overall I would stay at the Palace again. But why does the hotel have some great staff and some shockingly bad ones?;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

I rarely give 5 star ratings;5;25.10.2016;Given the price (200 Euro), the location, the ambiance and the breakfast. It is definitely one of the best hotel experiences I have encountered. My only slight disappointment is that the blonde Russian lady that checked me in on October 12 did not give me a full sea-view room as I tried to explain that I was in-process for a black status match with Discovery (which was granted the next day). It's ok....she gave me a partial seaview room in the new part of the hotel although I would have loved to have experienced the old part of the hotel/palace. Well maybe next time! The stay was topped off with a most amazing breakfast with plenty of smoked salmon! I would recommend this place to friends and family.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
One night of luxury;5;24.10.2016;During our honeymoon, my husband and I decided to treat ourselves with one night in the Kempinski hotel in Portoroz.I believe we spent around €380.00 so it was definitely not cheap, but luxury never is. However, it was worth it and here's why:The room - The room was spotless but to be honest, I would have expected no less from this hotel. Every detail was perfect, from the fluffiness of the bathrobes to the way the toilet paper was folded. The pool - In order to get a bit of movement before breakfast I spent the morning at and in the pool. I was pleasantly surprised that it was a salt water pool. Even though we were there in August the pool area was relatively empty in the morning, which was great. The relaxation area staff were great and attentative. Breakfast - I would go back there for the breakfast alone! It was absolutely magnificent and there was nothing left to be desired. Champagne and strawberries, all sorts of continental and English breakfast treats, fresh fruit ... it was perfect!Service - Everyone was super attentive and friendly. We checked in quite early which was no problem at all. We did mention that we were on our honeymoon and when we ca me back to our room in the evening someone had decorated the room and left a bottle of chilled champagne for us! Summary: It's expensive but worth it!;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Details matter;5;23.10.2016;The Kempinksi Palace is pricy, but so is luxury. All the service, the staff and the details are centered around the customer experience.

A 5 star hotel with excellent service in an ideal location;5;5.10.2016;The hotel lives up to the Kempinski 5 star experience and is more a business hotel than typical holiday hotel.. The staff were very friendly and helpful. It is expensive but being on the sea front there is plenty of choice outside. Being a seaside resort the front of the hotel can be noisy due to music at the beach and the bars/restaurants. We had a room at the back which is quiet but lacks views. Our accomodation, the spa, pool and one restaurant are in a new extension but that was just fine. The spa and pool were excellent and the service was extremely good.We went in September so it was quiet in the week but Portoroz is busy at the weekend but it is a very clean place and superior to British seaside towns.

Stunning wedding venue;5;30.09.2016;"My husband and I got married in Kempinski Palace Portorož on 10 September 2016.All chosen vendors, family & friends contributed to making our day truly remarkable. The venue itself, i.e. the grand Crystal Hall with its terrace, was simply grandiose and strikingly beautiful - huge crystal chandeliers, antique golden decor, all in all magnificent. The food was delicious, the cake was exactly as we wished for - compliments to the Chef and his team!Upon returning to our suite after the wedding - spacious duplex with a terrace on each floor, a king size bed and a jacuzzi - we were greeted with a bottle of champagne for a perfect ending of the day and we started the next day with a rich in-room breakfast, which was served on the terrace overlooking the Adriatic sea; perfect start of married life.As with most weddings, there were some shortcomings - e.g. the terrace on top of the modern part, where the ceremony was held, was quite unfurbished and high heels were making holes in the wooden floor, the waiters were not as experienced as one would expect and there were some mix-ups - however, upon highlighting these issues we were complimented with a gift voucher. Good customer service!We would definitely recommend Kempinski Palace Portorož - for a wedding or simply for staying in this hotel when visiting the Slovenian Coast. As we did before the wedding, we will certainly visit this hotel in the future as well, always reminiscing of our special day!Photo credit: Ana Gregoriè Photography";Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Old world elegance;4;27.09.2016;We had a sea view room with an enormous bath. I would not pay up for the water view as the buildings across the street from the hotel were quite unattractive.

Awesome hotel with friendly staff and comfortable facilities;5;20.09.2016;I stayed at this hotel for one night and it must be one of my most satisfactory stays among my travel experiences. My guest room was very spacious and clean with a balcony facing the sea. The staff was also really friendly and considerate that they positively responded to my requests and resolved my problem. For instance, they exceptionally led me to their roof top terrace so that I could enjoy the whole sea view from top right after I asked their concierge in the early morning whether there's any high floor terrace at this hotel for me to capture the sea view, even though their roof top terrace was still closed at that time. Such an outstanding service does give me unforgettable impression and deserve high recommendation for stays at this hotel.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

Not Quite a 5 Star Property could learn from other hotels ;2;5.09.2016;Stayed at this location for a holiday with friends. The old building is as beautiful as the pictures show. Warmly greeted and checked in quickly. I had a room in the old part of the building on the 5th. Something you don't expect when you come out of the elevator is writing by people on the walls. I then went into my room. The room was small and bathroom was compact. To have a shower you needed to stand in the bath, which is something I wouldn't expect in a 5 star hotel. The bed was comfortable. The window was small to let in natural light but guess this was the restriction of old building. A surprising point to note is the hotel will not let you have an iron, they have to iron for you at extortionate prices, which is really disappointing and not something I would expect for a hotel where you already paid out to try and rip you off. Finally the breakfast that I read so many good reviews on, failed to hit the spot for me. Don't get me wrong it was good but nothing that will amaze you, if you have stayed at Sofitels or Intercontinental Hotels.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Usual high Kempinski standards;5;5.09.2016;The staff excelled themselves, except for the chap who produced my car from the car park, pocketed the tip (the parking is paid for) and left the cases on the ground.Back to the good stuff. Excellent rooms (we were at the front of the palace in a deluxe) and barely heard any noise from the street outside. We were on the 1st floor and still got a good view of the sea etc, but I would suggest that despite having a shallow balcony, there is enough room for two slim bistro type chairs and a small table for a sundowner. Whilst not having an iron in the room is not fatal, you do have to plan your laundry schedule, as you can't do a last minute iron.Breakfast was delicious and that should not be a surprise in a Kempinski.In answer to criticism listed elsewhere, kettles are supplied upon request to make tea in the room, note they only have loose tea (supermarket is 5mins walk, exit left). They do supply water jugs and beakers for the pool area (upon request), there's a water fountain near the Jacuzzi. I would say they can't pack in any more sunbeds and they have a policy to prevent you leaving it empty for longer than 30 mins.The pool is much better than a chlorinated one(it's salt water) and heated, but can get quite busy at peak times.My suggestions are:1. They should alternate the sunbeds smoking zones (every 2 days) as the smoking area is much larger than the non smoking area.2. They should explore the benefits of adults only swimming times, eg first and last 2 hours.It's very family friendly, we booked two rooms (one for the teenager) but because both were deluxe they could not next door to each other. Next time, I would book one deluxe and one superior as they are adjacent. Connecting rooms also exist in the superior category.if you want to go the 'beach' it's a 20E surcharge (it's not theirs hence the charge), but having examined the beach it's just a strip of land (with probably imported sand) with closely packed sunbeds adjacent to the bay. It did not appeal. You can swim in the bay as there are access steps frequently inserted in the sea wall.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
It shouldn't get away with it;2;30.08.2016;It's easy to see why the Kempinski is the number one rated hotel in portoroz as it is a lovely hotel. I had a superior room in the new part of the hotel which was decorated well, with a very comfy queen size bed and a balcony. The hotel is well designed and the gardens and pool area are very nice. There are plenty of sun loungers and the only quibble about the pool is that it is sea water. I was there with friends but if you were looking for a romantic break then it would be a good choice.However I can't give the hotel a score of 4 which is what I'd ordinarily give it because of their application of a very silly rule that you can't iron in your room and have to use their laundry service.This is just a rip off. Starting at €8 euros a shirt and rising it is a rip off. I've stayed in hundreds of hotels all over the world and never before been told I can't get an iron. Just as I'll always score a hotel down if they don't have free wifi I will do the same here as there is no need to profit from shirts and other items of clothing getting creased while packed in luggage. I don't mind paying top dollar to stay in a hotel but this is naked profiteering so be warned to ensure you don't need anything ironing or else your bill will rocket;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Great summer escape;5;29.08.2016;We spent 4 nights at this holiday in the middle of the busy holiday season. We got two rooms for our family of five. The hotel turned out to be a great choice. Many features made our holiday one to remember:- breakfast open until 1200 ( fantastic for grown ups and kids)- salt water swimming pool ( our kids have some skin problems)- indoor pool ( helped us on a rainy day)- general courtesy of the hotel staff ( good to have service without the blackmail of huge tipping)- room ambience and amenities- locationMy wife and i had a dinner for two at the upscale restaurant and we found the food very good and the service extremely pleasant. We sincerely recommend this hotel with a note that ,at least in the period we staid, it does not come at a cheap price. The only note for improvement is that traveling the world i stay at many Kempisky hotels. In the Portoroz one only saw a Lady in Red only once when she was engaged in a very lenghty phone call and then disappeared in the back. Unusual indeed. ;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Brilliant hotel;5;29.08.2016;This really is a palace. It has magnificent rooms, facilities and service. We were in the old wing with a huge room overlooking the sea with lovely gardens underneath. The bathroom was huge. There is a modern wing to the palace - we did not see the rooms there. However friends in a room near that wing complained of noise fro the clubs opposite till teh early hours of the morning. We were further away in the old wing and were not disturbedThe balcony gave spectacular views of sunsets and was very romanticThe breakfast was in a huge room with a superb buffet - it was difficult to decide what to try. I always started with the ginger shot that set you up for the day. There was lots of fruit, cooked dishes, eggs, lots of different breads and really interesting jams and honeysThe service was impeccable. Everyone sat on the verandah if possible giving a lovely view of the garden and the seaThe hotel had an interesting art shop and other rooms worth exploringThere is a great sea water pool half indoors half outdoors.

Very nice hotel, probably nicest in the area.;5;24.08.2016;This is a very nice hotel. It was the Summer Palace for the Emperor of the Astro-Hungarian Empire.

Concierge gave us really good things to do in the area. Nice pool - big area. Across is more of a Bay/Habor then the Ocean, but it looked really nice and clean. the immediate area is either residential or this touristy, marina type area across the street - great if you have kids with you.

This is more of a 3 1/2 star review.. The hotel was beautiful, were were upgraded....;4;19.08.2016;... from a suite in the modern wing, to a large large suite in the Old Part of the hotel. It was huge, with 2 terraces.. Loved it. The check in was easy, and we were shown to our room. I was kinda speechless, because of the size.. And well appointed...However, the service from housekeeping, just has me so down on this place. Now we had 3 issues. One was that turn down service was inconsistent at best. One day we came home from dinner, and the place was rather filthy, still... This after a night of use and day for them to clean it, they did not. BUT they took the tip I left... We had the manager of housekeeping and the hotel manager come up to our room to show them, she even left piss in the toilet, with toilet paper. Was it hers', I usually flush. lolWe also were not left a single new towel, as we clearly put dirty ones in the bath tub. to be replaced..The last night left a really bad taste in my mouth about this place Horrible housekeeping..;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
A beautiful, historical building with amazing service;5;17.08.2016;Stayed two nights in the old, historical building of the hotel, in a spacious sea view room with a huge balcony at the 4th floor. Choosing a high (4th or 5th) floor room is a good decision as the street and the beach in front of the hotel can be very noisy during the nights. The rooms are beautiful, the breakfast is impressive and delicious. The service is at the top level, from the arrival till the last minute of the stay. The pool area is very nice but could be bigger as it's quite crowded during the high season.

Good be perfect but not quite;5;15.08.2016;Difficult to grade this hotel, in so many ways it is excellent but one or two aspects disappoint.The reception is very good and welcoming the public rooms are beautifully kept and all staff were super helpful and friendlyThe rooms are large ,we stayed in the new wing and the room was well equipped and the bed very comfortable and as we chose park views suffered no night time noiseThe breakfast is about as good as you can get with lovely fruit choices , breads are good as is the smoked salmon and the cooked foodsThe pool area is very attractive if somewhat busy in high season but if you get there at a sensible time you will find available bedsThe pool staff especially Oton are all excellent and try to help everyoneThe evening bar is lovely and very calmNow the bad things There is no kettle or coffee machine in the room and sometimes you just want to make yourself a drink in the room not call room serviceThe drinks and food in the hotel are super expensive compared to local prices, you cannot even get a jug of cold water for free round the poolThere are no special touches such as fruit round the pool, or night time chocolate with the turn down service these things are common in other 5 star hotelsAlso both restaurants serve very elaborate and expensive food I feel they would be better if one of the restaurants was a fresh grill type restaurant specialising in fish and steaks again this is often found in 5 star hotels around the worldWe have thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the hotel is a true oasis in a very busy resort The resort is fun and a little bit of a throw back to resorts of old in Italy and FranceWith a few changes this hotel would be perfect.

The Rose of Istria;5;15.08.2016;Although we spent only 2 days here with my husband the experience will be unforgettable.From the moment we arrived until the very end of our stay we felt ourselves very special.First of all, thanks for the Concierge for the warmest welcome i have ever received.Our room was on the 3rd floor of the Modern Wing, it was very comfy for a couple (however duvet sharing is not our preference) and decorated with the rose motif tastefully. The architecture of the whole hotel is a wow. Congratulations for the interior designers too.I do not want to repeat the earlier reviews, i agree that breakfast is superb and that the spa is fantastic.Let me just have a few other comments / recommendations.During check-in the hotel charges your card with the amount of the whole stay plus some more as deposit. We mentioned to the receptionist lady that we would like to provide it in cash, but she pretended that she did not understand. It is understandable that it is a policy but let the guest decide which way they wish to do this. When we asked how long the money will be blocked, they said few days which is actually 2 weeks. So be careful with that.The other thing which they may consider to improve is the pool bar service. It opens at around 10.30-11.00 which is quite late (at least for us) i believe.All in all, this is a great hotel in a lovely location and we will surely return soon.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Wonderful Palace, wonderful team;5;12.08.2016;I came 3 days to celebrate my birthday with my boyfriend and i have booked a Superior room with sea view. When we arrived they offered us an up grade : a wonderful suite with the sea view. At the restaurant, the night of my birthday, we had a very good diner and they offered me a chocolate birthday cake. What a nice present.All the staff is very nice and helpfull.The breakfast is delicious and so much choice. Thanks a lot to Rock the nice smiling waiter we had for our diner and every day at the breakfast.I forgot my shoes and i propose the hotel to charge my credit card to send it me back but they did it for free.We have travelled a lot, in many hotels, and many 5 stars hotel. This one is not maybe the most beautiful i ever been for the design, but the staff is definitly the best in the world. We really appreciate all the delicate attention, and the suite with this beautiful view.Thanks a lot to all the team. you made our trip unforgetable and my birhday very special.

Great experience;5;9.08.2016;Full breakfast with a wide choice of food. Smoked salmon, freshly squeezed orange juice, sparkling wine, a good choice of cheeses, fresh egg omelette,... My husband and I stayed only one night because we just stopped on the way home. Extended breakfast was just what we needed, because we arrived late. So we could sleep longer. We had a room in the new part, so we were not impressed bye the room. I would prefer a room in the old part, but it was full. We will return, next time for more days.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

Perfect;5;6.08.2016;"I stayed at Kempinski Palace between 18 July - 28 July 2016. We had a standard room.Reception:They were nice, polite and helpful. They spoke good English.Room:The room was large enough. The beds were comfortable. It was sufficient with wardrobes.Bathroom:The bathroom only had a bathtub.I prefere a stand alone shower. The hair dryer was not working very good. Hint bring your own.Poolarea:The area was large. There was enough sunbeds and they were comfortable. Sun towels were plentiful. As a non-smoker I was happy that one part of the area was for non-smokers only. The supervisor Oton was very helpful and friendly. He was also very observant when something needed attention.Wifi:Wifi was excellent. We could stream from Netflix. Cleaning:The cleaning of the public areas (ie toilettes) was not acceptable. Some guests do not flush... I do not want to act as a \flushing lady\"".All in all, we had a wonderful stay and we will come back.""";Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
The best hotel ever?;5;4.08.2016;I'm not sure where to start but this has to be one of the finest hotels anywhere. Having spent many holidays in Monaco I never thought I would find a hotel as good as this, especially in Slovenia!One of the most enjoyable and comfortable stays that you could possibly imagine. Incredible quality and luxury with the most amazing staff you could ever wish to meet anywhere. Super restaurants and great buffet breakfast. Every hotel can learn from staying here. Thanks a million and see you next year.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Amazing stay even for non-smokers;5;3.08.2016;"We stayed 10 days at Kempinski and this is my hionest review. I will divide it into separate sections for easier reading.ArrivalWe drove by car and was immediately greated by Nace who took care of our luggage whilst we checked in. Very nice first impression.ReceptionDuring the stay we had several contacts with the reception. The reception was very friendly and always took the time to listen to what's on our mind. I would like to in particular point out Natalias great work; she always made sure that our comments and questions were properly followed up instead of just being passive. Very good and an example how the reception should work.RoomsWe had a superior room facing the mountains. The room was large enough and contained all necessary items, including a refrigerator. A nice room, all in all.CleaningThe cleaning was usually properly done. There were a constant problem with the towels however. The \package\"" contained seven different towels but it seldom worked to get them back; sometimes we gor eight, sometimes five and anything in between. It was corrected after calling the reception, but it is strange that it could not work (which the reception agreed about).PoolareaThe poolarea contains of two parts, one facing Lucija and the other facing Piran. One of the parts are for non-smokers which is great. The poolarea is supervised by Oton, who takes great pride in making the poolarea clean and inviting. He seems to consider the area as a place for his guests and his task as \""host\"" is to ensure that everyone is having a great time. He is splendid, always cleaning, assisting with umbrellas or chatting with the guests. Oton is a great asset to Kempinski. It should be mentioned that when Oton is not there, the area is not well supervised and the atmosphere is different. InternetThe internet is very fast and reliable. I value that a lot.RestaurantsWe used one of the restaurants (not \""Sophia\"" but the other), Nothing to complain about regarding the food, but it is very expensive - more than double or even triple the cost for a lunch at the restaurants across the street (10 meters away from the hotel).BreakfastThe breakfast options are great; you can choose from a lot of different items and there is no need to go hungry. You can choose at least semi healthy choices as well, which I value since I train a lot. However, it should be pointed out that the staff working at breakfast is far less polite than the staff in general. In fact, breakfast staffs behaviour(not the chef!) could be improved quite a bit. For instance do they remove your plate even when you are not done and are very stressed even when there is few guests (we ate breakfast at 0700 and there were approx six-seven guests present). - The breakfast area is divided into a smokers' and non-smokers' department.Washing serviceHotel offers a washing service. The prices are however almost ridiculus and I doubt that anyone would use the service (at least nor for common clothes like a pair of trousers).ACThe rooms have manually adjustable AC. However, please bear in mind that AC degrees may differ from what you may be used to. We usually have 22 degrees in order to be able to sleep, but at Kempinski we had 17 degrees. Do not hesitate to ask the reception for a lower range of degrees (20-24 degrees is standard but can be lowered if asked in reception).GeneralKempinski is a five star hotel and well worth it. The ambience is great and there is a lot of attention to details. To attract non-smokers, it is important to maintain non-smoker areas. I would recommend Kempinski and will consider to return.""";Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Excellent Hotel;5;1.08.2016;Everything was nice about this hotel--the rooms, the location, the service. I wish we could have stayed longer, but we were on a whirlwind tour of this part of the world.

Had expected more;3;25.07.2016;"Very nice place but too pricey for what it offers. That food is really poor quality. You don't get fresh bread on Sunday.

Hotel with a soul;5;25.07.2016;Very cozy hotel with big rooms. One of my favourite places for breakfast ever.

Grand Old Hotel with Modern Addition;5;24.07.2016;We spent three nights at the Kempinski Palace and were delighted with the service, location, and room. We were given a complementary upgrade to a suite in the new part of the hotel with a large, L shaped balcony overlooking the pool and the sea beyond. Breakfast is taken in the old hotel in a beautiful setting. Staff were excellent as one expects in a Kempinski.

Unpleasant lack of security + hospitality;3;24.07.2016;Unlike in premium properties around the world, in this hotel you don't require your room card to activate the lift. The reception is on a different floor to the beach-side entrance, so there is no-one checking who is entering the hotel directly from the street or the beach. When I mentioned this to reception, the woman laughed and said, 'well we can't have someone on duty with a gun!' This in the week of the Nice atrocity and the shootings in Munich. Unlike other lucky people on Trup Advirso, our check-in was neither speedy nor friendly. No-one showed us around our room, or showed us how things worked. And after our journey to Portoroz in divine 35 degrees heat, we were disappointed there was no welcoming touch such as a free half bottle of water. We booked this hotel partly because the pool looked so heavenly - but be advised that at the peak season, you are unlikely to get a sun-lounger at all! Crammed in like sardines. Most unappealing. You can however pay 20 Euros per person to sunbathe at a private beach!! We walked up the coast and found an unspoiled free area under pine trees - much more our style. The Concierge men were super-helpful and smiley, and the breakfasts are great. However, we disagree with those who say the double-glazing is effective. We stayed in the old wing and even with ear-plugs you can hear some bass beats from a couple of bars - bearable, but do pack your ear-plugs. A door in the bathroom fell off but they fixed it within 24 hours. Just check the toiletries - ours had their seals broken, suggesting they were not fresh for our use. When we checked out we again mentioned the security issue and a woman in red was at least sympathetic. However our disappointment that despite paying for a certain category of room we hadn't had the expected balcony was met with the response that she would make sure we had a better room next time. Too late, my dear.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Just AMAZING!!!;5;20.07.2016;I cannot say anything negative about this fabulous hotel.From the moment we arrived the reception staff could not have been more friendly and welcoming and this continued throughout our stay with all the staff. Absolutely beautiful hotel in an equally beautiful location.

A great place for a little getaway;4;8.07.2016;"I've stayed here a couple times. The first time we booked a sea-view room which was situation in the new building and overlooking the pool. The room was very clean and and modern. The second time I went, I booked a twin room. This room overlooked the \park\"" (more like parking area), but had a very nice wrap-around balcony. The room seemed a bit more worn that the first one I stayed at and also the TV seemed to not be working properly as the quality was very poor. The hotel is just minutes from the Croatian border so we ended up heading over to Buje for a delicious truffle dinner. There are also lots of restaurants in the area right at the waterfront.The staff was very friendly. We arrived very early and our room was understandably not ready for check-in, however they allowed us to use the pool and spa facilities. They even offered us a locker to store our things in.

So far the best stay here;5;16.06.2016;This year it was our third time to spend a short holiday at this hotel. The room was wonderful and we have learned by now that one must ask at the reception to lower the temperature in the room, since A/C control in the room is limited. Breakfast until 12 o`clock is a huge advantage (one can go jogging and/or swimming before breakfast and still sleep long hours).

Best hotel in Portoroz;5;2.06.2016;I often visit Portoroz and already tried all their hotels. Kempinski is really something different, better and very classy. Feels like pure luxury.

Hotel With the WOW Factor;5;26.05.2016;I was only here for a night on business, so did not have time to check out many facilities.However, if you want a hotel that hits you full on with that OMG feeling, then this fits the bill. Located on the Slovenian riviera, it is definitely impressive in terms of location, architecture and style. If you want to impress someone, bring them here.I stayed in the old part, which has impressively wide halls. My room was on the cheap side, overlooking the entrance. If you want to push the boat out, stay on the pool side.The shower was not a dedicated one, but I was still happy with the fixtures. The room was very quiet, I slept with my outer patio door open and enjoyed the fresh air and gentle birdsong in the morning, that was not overwhelming.The room had a robe, minibar and a decent TV with a very good selection.

Just 5 star with some issues;5;21.05.2016;A very nice hotel no doubt but be careful when you book as the hotel is in two sections. New and old. Some rooms do not have a walk in shower which is unbelievable for a 5 star hotel of this expense. My room in the new section was very nice however design was a little strange in the bathroom with tiny shower (with small mould) in comparison to other 5 star hotels around the world but it had ample other wasted space. Also it seems no aircon but perhaps I could not work the controls or Maybe city regulation for this period.Staff attitude is inconsistent however to be fair it may be the language barrier. Some front counter staff were fantastic however on every occasion I found the concierge very serious with one word answers and appearing grumpy. Possible language barrier.Breakfast excellent in beautiful ballroom. Location is about 2.5 km from Piran. Generally a good stay but everything is measured against price. For the right price then yes...5 star. If you pay too much then no. ;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Would happily give this hotel five stars if it only had decent fitness facilities;4;21.05.2016;It's a pity that I am forced to give this hotel four stars, but four and a half are not an option and I won't give five stars to a hotel with such meager fitness facilities. The pool looked very nice, but five assorted cardio machines, one Smith machine, a sit-up bench and some dumbbells are ridiculously short of a proper fitness room and flagrantly beneath the standard of the rest of this hotel. Otherwise I have no complaint. The location was central, with the beach just across the road (on the other side of a commercial strip featuring restaurants, fast food places and diverse shops). The breakfast was very good, with several hot vegan items (today including hash browns, mixed broiled vegetables and mushrooms), three non-dairy types of milk, vegan croissants (kudos to the hotel for being this progressive) and about six kinds of fresh fruit. My one dinner in the hotel (salmon) was excellent and the massage was also very good. My room (in the new part of the hotel) was more than adequate, with a separate bathtub and shower (oddly, no conditioner or body lotion, but these and a top-notch shaving kit were brought on request) and a balcony (sadly, I was unable to open the door). Staff was very pleasant and helpful throughout, internet was free and worked without a hitch. I would have absolutely no problem giving this hotel five stars if only it had halfway appropriate fitness facilities.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

A true 5* hotel!;5;11.04.2016;"My husband and I stayed here for just 1 night, but really liked it. The hotel buildings are very nice, the old one and the new one. We were given a room in the new block, which had access directly to the pool and spa, we liked that. The balcony was also nice sized, with 2 chairs and a table, of course. The bed was very comfortable and we slept great.The turn down service left us a bottle of iced sparkling wine and we ordered in some ice cream, we enjoyed it very much. The pool and the spa were nice, not too big, but not too crowded. Unfortunately, the outdoor pool was closed due to the rain, but we liked the concept of the indoor pool spreading outside. The chairs and beds are very comfortable, you can easily fell asleep. The wifi worked great.Breakfast was quite \royal\"" in the crystal hall, great choice of fruit...enjoyed it!The only negative thing was the salted water in the pool, but that is just me. And there were no body lotion in the room, but i brought my own, so did not call the housekeeping. But if I did, I am sure I would be given some :)And I wish the the pool bar was open, but maybe it is closed due to the low season still. We will be back for sure, we liked the hotel, the staff, the food and the nice walk around Portoroz and Piran.

The hotel bar was very nice with excellent recommendations for Slovenian wines. Sitting outside with the propane heater in the later afternoons/early evening was a treat. The breakfast buffet was very nice with fresh food and cooked to order eggs and omelets. The location is great wtih many restaurants and casinos within a short walk.

Not really 5-star;4;5.01.2016;I was there with my friend in July. The hotel is not very clean, I found everywhere dirty things (on the floor, the windows, doors, lift). At the swimming pool we had to wait 20 minutes for 2 drinks, it was only a lemonade. They bring the drinks is old plastic glass, for me it is not 5 star. The room is also not so clean, I found nails on the floor, a very old bamboo was in the bathroom in a vase without water... The bamboo was yellow. I gave it to the room attendant, she didn't understand what my problem with the bamboo was.... At the breakfast we also had to wait 20 minutes for a meal. I think there was not enough personal at the service and that's why they couldn't bring 5-star service to the guests.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

1st wedding anniversary;5;16.10.2015;Our journey started when we met Stephan who picked us from the airport. He was very professional and polite. We were warmly greeted at the hotel by Karmen and the concierge. Karmen brought us to our room and explained everything to us. We had a nice touch to our room by housekeeping as it was our first anniversary. We had dinner at Sophia restaurant. It was just wow, delicious food, wine, service. The team in the restaurant exceeded our expectation. Alison is another great asset to the company. She knew exactly what we wanted for breakfast each day. Champagne, pancakes you name it...Peter, the concierge is another plus so helpful and professional. We wanted to go to a particular shop on sunday and he called the shop to make sure it was opened. We read so many views before we went to the hotel and I can say now that the staff are a real asset to the hotel.

Impressive in every way;5;2.10.2015;My visit was sadly short but nonetheless very impressive - every aspect from arrival to departure was efficiently handled in a friendly and warm way.Kempinski properties are generally very well sorted, but here the location overlooking the sea was delightful and the facilities within the property were excellent.But as so often in Kempinski hotels it was the knowledge, the attitude and the attention of the people that ally make them stand out! On reception everything was swift and efficient. The room staff were quiet, swift and delightful. In the bar the dedication and professionalism was spot on. At the Sophia restaurant service was impeccable and the knowledge of the sommelier - Sergej was tremendous and he came up with Slovakian wines that were full of character, intriguing in style and just a downright pleasure to drink too much of!I was fortunate enough to be in a suite in the older part of the hotel - sublimely elegant - but I also saw the rooms in the new wing and they were bright, lively and just as well equipped.This is a Kempinski I would happily return to for business or for pleasure and be totally confident that the experience would be perfect.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

Great hotel! Luxury indeed.;5;8.09.2015;"We stayed for a weekend. The hotel met or even exceeded our expectations, which were quite high (one does expect to get much when paying such room rates). PROS:The location and setting is great - the hotel is a historic building on the promenade in the centre of Portoroz. The room (superior = basic) was exquisitely furnished, clean and well maintained. It was also quite soundproof. Bed offered a very good sleep quality.The beach is not hotel's own - you can use the public beach or you can choose to use the nearby \posh\"" Meduza beach, which costs 20Eur per day for hotel guests. We did not swim at the beach, but at the pool that's part of the spa - very nice, though a bit cool in September. There are also different saunas and a friendly relax area. Food - the breakfast was terrific - if you want to start a day with sparkling wine and strawberries, a hearty sandwich parade or just a croissant and fruits, it's all there - I believe I could stay a week and not get tired of the breakfast... there is also a choice of newspapers for the guests (free). The dining room takes you to early 1900s - it's the \""crystal hall\"" that used to be an imperial ball room.CONS: None really... oh, at check in, the young receptionist seemed a bit too immersed in her own feeling of self-importance to make us feel really welcome... but this was fixed right as we met another hotel employee and continued to be perfect until the check-out.""";Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Expensive car parking charges;4;24.08.2015;Good size rooms, really nice friendly staff.The breakfast was OK.The hotel is just across the road from the beach.The rooms are very nice with comfy beds.I don't agree with being charged €18 extra a night for car parking when I had paid around €250 a night to stay in the hotel. The car parking should be included.The pool area is lovely but my only complaint was that every one smokes around the pool. I had 2 men smoking cigars near me which was really annoying and spoilt my enjoyment. I had to leave the pool to go to the public beach as everyone was smoking.There should be non smoking areas in places like this and for that reason I probably wouldn't return here unless the smoking policy changed. I was informed by the pool attendant that previously the hotel did have half the pool non smoking but then they did away with it, most probably because everyone in Slovenia smokes. The same goes for the bars and restaurants. If you want to sit on the terrace to eat your breakfast be prepared to be sat in clouds of cigarette smoke. I didn't really bother with bars or restaurants in the hotel for this reason.

Incredibly disappointed ;1;18.08.2015;I have stayed at many 5 stars (including other Kempinski properties) and this place does not compare. We had an issue at check in which (to their credit) the front desk was eventually helpful in resolving after we spoke with the manager. The first room we saw had writing, stains and smudges all over the walls (which was right next to the bed as it was so small). The second room (while larger with a sea view) had stains all over the carpet but worst of all a serious ant problem - particularly annoying as we were on the 4th floor. We asked for housekeeping to clean the room thoroughly, which they said they did, but in the morning, the ants were back, and in a completely different spot. On top of all that, the shower in the room was poorly designed and barely functioned... Additionally, the spa is budget, with very small sauna facilities, and just an overall lack of environment. The two positives were the pool and the breakfast, both which were quite nice. While the hotel has a gorgeous exterior, it seems as though they did the most minimal amount of work on the interior. Not at all what I expect (and have experienced) at other Kempinskis. We only stayed one night and we were happy to be leaving the next morning...;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
A great place to celebrate our 30th Wedding Annivarsary;5;16.08.2015;This is a 5 star hotel at its best. Beautiful location. Great heated salt pool. Large rooms, comfortable beds and helpful and friendly staff. The spa is a must too. The breakfast is amazing. What better way to start the day with champagne and smoked salmon. Before arriving at the hotel I e-mailed the hotel to say that my wife and I were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary. To our great surprise then decorated our room with rose petals, ornamental swans and free champagne (see photo) This was a very nice touch. We stayed for 6 nights and enjoyed every minute.

Great stay;4;14.08.2015;The hotel itself is unsurpassed in terms of comfort and service. Highlights are spacious rooms, incredibly comfortable beds and air conditioning that is pitched at the right level. Situated right on Portoroz's front, it's a short hop to the beach and restaurants along the short strip. There's a kid's playground and funfair there. Other than this, there's not loads to do in Portoroz. Around the headland is the very pretty town of Piran, a bit like Venice, and that's good for an explore - but on a 35-degree day in August that felt a bit too much like hard work. So we hung out by the pool. For some reason the pool is salt water. Great for floating yet more annoying for actual swimming (and for your bar drink bill). But jumping into the pool is just glorious relief from that searing Adriatic sun. The hotel is very kid friendly and there are kids of all nationalities running around (in a controlled manner!). It's been a fun stay overall. ;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

Nice hotel in a brilliant location;4;7.08.2015;Stayed 6 nights and was very happy with the our stay. The breakfast was brilliant and full of different options. Our room was very spacious and comfortable. The swimming pool was fantastic and well attended. Only two bits of feedback - The ac in the lobby area does not work and neither in the main restaurant. We had a very uncomfortable dinner the one night we decided to have dinner at the hotel (the food was fantastic though). Your pool staff wear crocs with socks because they are forced to by management - that's not cool at all - you may want to cut them some slack with this one and commend them on what a brilliant job they are doing.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Overall, A Bit Disappointed;3;7.08.2015;We stayed in Portoroz mainly to visit the nearby town of Piran. Although the concierge could not do enough for us upon our arrival and during our stay at the hotel, we were disappointed with the double deluxe room we had booked as it did not have a balcony (with a sea view) as indicated on our booking form. Our request to be moved to another hotel room with a balcony were granted after much negotiation and we moved hotel rooms from the older part of the hotel to the (almost) newly built annex, overlooking the swimming pool. The staff during breakfast were not the friendliest and special orders took a long time to prepare – if indeed, they did even arrive at the breakfast table. WIFI was fast and stable. The pool was excellent and one of the best. To summarise, the three night stay did not live up to expectations..;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

Outstanding Hotel and Location;5;2.08.2015;We stayed 4 nights at the Kempinski and loved every minute. The staff are really great, helpful and always smiling. The guys who look after the pool and spa were fantastic. Made a huge effort to find us a space one day and remembered us the second time as well. Other than breakfast we only ate at the hotel once (too much choice across the road) and the food was good. Rooms are a good size and very well kept. Really enjoyed the stay and we'll be back again next year.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Wonderful holiday in this lovel hotel;5;29.07.2015;Stayed in the Kempinski Palace for two weeks, 10/6/15 to 24/6/15From the minute you walk in to reception you know that this is very much a 5 star hotelOur room was very spacious with a balcony overlooking the beautiful front gardens. The room was kept immaculate throughout our stay. Very comfy double bed.We were on a Half Board basis, breakfast was buffet style with an excellent selection of hot and cold dishes. Big bonus was that breakfast is served up to 12:00 so no rush.the evening meal was fine dinning with a very good menus and faultless service from the very friendly staff. If not on half board there are numerous local bars and restaurants all just across the road from the hotel. There are two pools both salt water, outdoor pool connects to the indoor poolPool are was very well staffed by friendly pool attendants and waiters, sunbeds were very comfortable and clean fresh towels always available.All in all we wanted a relaxing 5 star holiday and that is exactly what we got;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Not really as exclusive as the brand suggests;3;28.07.2015;For sure this is a good, proper hotel. Also it has features which are fabulous (some of the interior design, the ballroom they use for breakfast area, the bed). At the same time this is priced at the top of the high end and the overall experience does not match that. We planned to leave on a Saturday morning and after seeing what type of crowd this place attracted for the week-end we really felt that was a great planning decision.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Loved it;5;28.07.2015;It is the best hotel in Portoroz, the rooms are lovely, the hotel doesnt have their own beach place but they send you to the meduza beach area where with a coupon given by the hotel you pay half the price.The breakfast is nice but there was lack of pastries in my opinion, lots of breads and croissants but no other choices (we already mentioned it to Thomaslav the manager)If you are going to Portoroz this is the hotel for you;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Great Location, quality services.;5;24.07.2015;I stayed 1 nights in Kempinski. It is the best hotel in Portoroz and also for the around destinations near the seaside. My room was standard basic but enough for 2 people. All the rooms have nice balcony. with very reasonable cost you can upgrade your room with sea view. Hotel has pool and also very close to the public beach. But if you want to use the private area, hotel has a agreement with one of the private beach which is also very close to hotel. You are just crossing the street and reach the beach. Breakfast was very good and in the evening you have wonderful cocktail at the terrace with facing the street and the sea and with the live piano recital.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
If you want to feel like royalty (for a while);5;24.07.2015;A truly top-notch hotel with highly-qualified, competent, and friendly staff. The rooms are spacious, comfortable, with rather luxurious bathrooms.Breakfast in the Kempinski Palace is an experience of its own. The selection of foods was astonishing, from cold cuts to freshly prepared eggs to order. And the glass of bubbly with strawberries was the proverbial cherry on the cake.There are only two downsides to my experience. The first one was the pool. The outdoor part of the pool wasn't yet open in April, and the indoor pool wasn't heated. And the second one was the parking. There's no free parking on site, only valet parking that cost 18 EUR per day. It's much cheaper to park on the street, but the ticket machines don't always work.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

Excellent design;5;20.07.2015;Liked the design of the hotel it is very beautiful. The food both dinner and breakfast was good. Portoroz was not very interesting city so location of the hotel is not perfect. The service at the hotel is not the best so 4,5 should be the correct rating.

Not a five star service;4;11.07.2015;We spent two short holidays in Kempinski Portoroz this year. We like the hotel, since it is really beautiful. Unfortunately the service in the hotel is not a service you would expect in a five star hotel. The most terrible is service by the pool. In my view they are not well organized and they do not have enough people working in the bar at the pool either. It is very hard to get a hold of someone first and then you wait again long time to get drinks/ food. It was the same last year and the year before and nothing changed. As for the breakfast, service and variety of food is not a five star. We had good experience with the staff at the reception and with the concierge though. This hotel should really look up to Kempinski in Savudrija where the service and the staff are impeccable.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Perfect Hotel!!!! Wonderful location!!!!;5;8.07.2015;Hotel is wonderful. It mixes modern and classic architecture in a perfect way. Great staff! We stayed for only 1 night but we could enjoy the wonderful swimming pool, perfect location to go to the beach and very good restaurant.

Wow,;5;24.06.2015;Hotel is amazing and very luxurious. My room was in the new building and overlooking the park. Very spacious and modern. You get the complimentary bottle of water. The bathroom was WOW. Bathtub and the shower, as if I jumped in a magazine . Reception desk and the lobby are very nice. You sit in a chair and get a very personalized check in. Food is great. I had the best waffles in my entire life. Location is great but it lacks the private beach area, which is compensated by the hammocks in the garden and the most amazing pool. If you choose the beach it is just outside the hotel across the street, a sandy public beach with mesmerizing pine tree smell. Additional bonus is the promenade along the beach connecting Portoroz and Piran-a gem on the Slovenian coast.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Loved it;5;19.06.2015;Stayed at the Kempinski for one week on a Jet2 airlines holiday from Edinburgh, first time in Slovenia and it will not be our last. The hotel is amazing, cannot fault it in any way. The staff are their biggest asset, so friendly and helpful. We were driven to the hotel from Pula airport in Croatia in a brand new BMW 5series, only took 40mins. Our room was perfect in the old part of the hotel with balcony and sea view. Resort is modern but not too busy, Piran just 10mins up the coast in a local bus(2 euros) is a picture postcard gem. Went to Llubljana and Bled on a one day trip with Kompas travel arranged by Jet2 rep, was well worth the money for our own driver/guide. Hotel breakfast is awesome and served until midday if you like a slow start, will be back next year with Jet2.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Beautiful Hotel, Perfect Location;5;19.06.2015;Absolutely wonderful experience. Our room was surprisingly large, with a nice balcony and a beautiful ocean view.

Family-Friendly Luxury;5;16.06.2015;The Kempinski hotel brand has continuously exceeded our expectations. We are a family with two small children who enjoys luxury travel. Unfortunately there are not many hotels who cater to this demographic. The Staff at the Kempinski Palace Portoroz was exceptionally welcoming to our children. They made us feel as though they actually enjoyed having them visit. Upon arrival we were upgraded from a junior 'Rose' suite to a 'Venice' suite. It was very spacious with a gorgeous balcony overlooking the Piran Bay. The children's menu at the restaurant had an excellent variety of entrees, my son loved having his own personal bathrobe and they gave him a complimentary cookie at the ice cream shop. We also love that we are all able to enjoy the spa pool (which is often adult-only at other hotel brands). The concierge (I believe his name was Kristijan) went above and beyond to assist us with restaurant recommendations and suggestions for kid-friendly activities. He even helped carry my infant son in his stroller up the steps to the restaurant each evening! I cannot compliment him enough. This is the 3rd Kempinski hotel we have visited in Europe, and Kempinski is fast becoming our go-to hotel brand. We only wish they had locations in the USA! Thank you to the wonderful staff at Kemponski Palace in Portoroz for treating us to the perfect vacation.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
it ROZ to the occasion;5;9.06.2015;"2 nights stay with Chase Ultimate rewards. Not sure if hotel was aware and satisfied with a room on the side, towards the back on the top floor of the new wing. Check in smooth/ escorted to room. Prompt luggage delivery and promptly provided with extra pillows and a second luggage rack. 18 euro/day valet parking fine considering you pay on street 24hrs and theres no apparent option.Wide comfortable twin beds. It was indicated to us, and they promptly lowered the lower setting on the A/C since we like it cool. Great housekeeping. The Rose theme continues with even the toilet paper!Receptionist a bit too enthusiastic promoting on site restaurants and no suggestions locally, but after a stroll we returned for a lovely dinner at Fleur de Sel. Suggested a taxi to Piran but the 1.5euro bus runs 24 hrs and is convenient and wasn't crowded. Very nice breakfast spread with attentive service al fresco.Despite the usual sign I was dismayed to see that loungers were reserved early by a few folk who in the 4 hrs I spent by pool never showed up. Nice to have those terry slipcovers on loungers but they were not changed overnight (leaving me to wonder how often they are), so most people used 2 towels to lay on. Liked the jetted massage seating area and the outdoor inverted fresh water shower that is activated by standing on it. Plenty of loungers well arranged with the majority facing the sun for the afternoon. Plenty of shade umbrellas too.The \beach\"" across the street is a relatively honky tonk and univiting.

A nice, relaxing stay;4;2.06.2015;We visited second year in a row. Made the similar booking as last year, as we liked the room and the balcony in a new part of the hotel very much. However... on arrival we were offered the room in the old part of the hotel on the fifth floor, which was not only smaller than other standard rooms, but was also without a balcony. With just a small window it had a claustrophobic feel, really. Not 5***** and definitely not the room that one would expect from Kempinski. We were so shocked by the difference - we still had last year`s room in our mind - that we went back to the reception, asking for a room with at least a balcony. Which was fortunately granted. It seems that apart of the fifth floor the other rooms have a balcony (not evident when you try to book, though). The room was in the old part of the hotel, but nothing wrong with that. Balcony was also smaller than in the new part, but the view on the park was splendid. And the room was large, comfortable and full of natural light. From then on we enjoyed our holiday as planned. The hotel is really nice and the services are in general good. The room for improvement is breakfast, similar as last year. There is plenty of serving staff outside, but inside where the food is, one has to remind the personnel way too often (when there is one around) to replace the missing items.Will probably return next year.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

Wow Factor is High (upgrade may have helped!);5;29.05.2015;"We (couple) stayed at the Kempinski Palace in Portoroz in May and were upgraded a Palace Suite that left us giddy, and running around the NY-apartment-sized suite for 20 minutes! Talk about a huge suite with full dining room table for 8, living room, 2 bathrooms, garnite shower and whirlpool tub, huge bedroom with king bed, 2 balconies, and closet space enough for a 3-month stay! We instantly wished we had booked a week instead of a day.Sophia's restauarant was wonderful as well, albeit a nouvelle cuisine of sorts. Although at the time we may have commented at the small portions for the price, our stomachs thanked us later that we were not stuffed beyond comfort, like so often happens on a vacation. Service was excellent; prices were high.Included breakfast (buffet) was bountiful and had great variety. It was hopin' busy place, yet the staff retained their friendliness and attention to detail.Spa area and services were the least of the wow factor. It was nice and the staff were nice, but as far as luxury spas go, it was just ok. Mainly because the greeting/reception area was confusing and then not much to it. Also the co-ed locker area and steam rooms just wasn't my cup of tea...I don't like changing with men walking by. (There was one private room to change in, but only one and then I had to move things back and forth to locker.)Hotel check-in/reception was exceptional!";Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

Wonderful hotel across the road from the beach;5;30.04.2015;From the moment you arrive you are made to feel so welcome by the porter that you will happily pay the exhorbitant 18 euro per night parking fee but since it includes valet parking in the end you're quite happy about it.You are then warmly welcomed by a charming receptionist who makes you feel like a valued guest.My room was in the modern building and was lovely with a big balcony overlooking the garden and two comfortable armchairs. The double bed was huge and really comfortable too.I had a Brazilian wax in the beauty salon and was very pleased with it. I then happily jumped into the heated to 27 degrees outdoor pool only to get the shock of finding out from the horrible stinging in my bikini area that it was a salt water pool. The indoor pool was also salt water and I prefer my salt on my fish and chips. I would much rather have had a fresh water pool.The most amazing part of my stay was the African housekeeper Mustafa who came to my room in the evening with a big smile and greeted me by name to see if he could do my turndown service. I asked him to come back later. On the way out I pressed the housekeeper button and had barely reached the lift when he appeared again with his trolley.When I got back from dinner at the excellent local gourmet restaurant Rizi Bizi, I discovered my room in pristine condition with all my stuff straightened out and even the cable of my iPhone neatly coiled, I was amazed at the level of service.Breakfast was in a beautiful ballroom with an extensive selection of items and the best thing was that breakfast was available until midday, another fantastic idea.Wifi was available everywhere free of charge and with no fiddly codes, one more thing to be happy about.In fact I was so happy with the whole experience that I didn't want to leave.The only tiny thing that bothered me was that the bidet was too close to the toilet.Bidet;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

Good option close to Piran;5;26.12.2014;Stayed with my wife and two young children in September on a 10 week tour of Europe. Modern hotel with very good facilities. Rooms were spacious and modern. I would probably call it a business hotel as it has large conference facilities, etc., which could mean it might get rather crowded, but when we were there it was fully booked and it did not feel crowded. Good spa with nice indoor and outdoor pool. Good location in the middle of Portoroz and just a 5 minute drive from beautiful Piran. We stayed here instead of Piran because we wanted the full set of amenities. We felt it was good value for a business 5 star hotel. The one negative was the large breakfast room which was a rather manic and crowded.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

Well, this is a 5 star Kempinski, so we were absolutely satisfied with the room and everything. Didn't try the outside pool, because it was cold or closed at this time of the year. Pool area and spa is nothing special for me. Breakfast in the ballroom is very nice, looking at the garden area, a big plus for the breakfast till noon. Parking fee is a little expensive.

My only concern is here - service at the pool is sporadic, almost absent and not very helpful - did not help with towels and I had to convince them to call the reception for assistance since they could not help. My praise is for the cleaning lady at the pool who tried her best to assist even if it was not her duty, while the pool guy was a bit lost.The room was nice with an extremely comfortable bed. Breakfast is simply excellent and enjoyable on the terrace overlooking the beautiful garden - i would have expected warm dishes prepared on the spot - which were not available. If you are in Portoroz dont look for anything else, and enjoy this hotel.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
An Unforgetable Experience;5;9.10.2014;I've stayed at the Kempinski for 6 nights during September, and it was absolutely terrific!From an enormous number of e-mails to the wonderful concierge Kristijan, to the moment of checking in with lovely Cramen and the efficient Peter from Bell boys, everything went fluently.The hotel is a classic modern design, rooms are extremely comfortable and clean.Breakfast was superb! And the stuff always knew all of my favorite dishes and coffee.The spa was amazing, I had two treatments with a wonderful female therapist.Pool and other facilities are great as well.I felt very welcome every time I walked inside of the hotel. The stuff is fantastic!!I would like to thank the great staff and especially: Peter, Kristijan, Carmen, Liliana and Daniel for being so kind and helpful.All of the above are a credit to the Hotel, they portrays the epitome of real excellent customer service. Always smiling and welcoming every time of the stressful day.Thank you Kempinski for a beautiful vacation. I am sure I'll be back!Linoy;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
A perfect stay! Must visit!;5;9.10.2014;My husband and I were blown away by this beautiful hotel and wish we could have stayed much longer than our two nights. Upon our arrival, the hotel set up a lovely display of rose petals on our bed (this was one stop on a 3 week honeymoon in Europe) as shown in my pictures. The staff and bellmen were some of the friendliest and most helpful hotel employees that we have come across in all of our travels. Great bedroom and balcony with a view, excellent location, great gym/spa/pool, and fabulous, fabulous brunch - which was included with our stay! We felt so comfortable and relaxed in Portoroz, and will be recommending this little gem of a town, along with the Kempinski, to anyone traveling in this area! This hotel provided the ultimate relaxation, and was a welcome stop after a few weeks on the road. I hope to be back at some point!

fantastic stay ... can we give 6 stars? :-);5;7.10.2014;we had a great stay and we stayed at the 'rose suite' room 242 and that was incredibly clever decorated ... much space..beautiful bathroom with bath and shower and a beautiful picture of a rose in the room.. no problems with noise from other rooms as you are here in a corner room and that is perfect..the sleep quality is on a very high level . Please look to my other reviews for the restaurants.. the swimming pool is also very beautiful and more than enough sun loungers..Here you should not fight for a deck chair..place enough.. the service in this hotel is more than ok and of a high standard. so don't hesitate and book.

Historical palace at Slovenian Riviera;5;7.10.2014;Wish I spent more time at this majestic hotel! 1 night stay at this property was flawless. The hotel has 2 buildings — historical and modern one, both facing the Adriatic Sea. Unfortunately there is no drive-in to the main façade entrance and you should drive back the building and enter the hotel from the back. As Wikipedia says the legendary hotel opened on 20 August 1910 at the time of Austro-Hungarian Empire to host rich and famous at Austrian Riviera. Indeed you feel like an Erzherzog on vacation as soon as you step into this palace hotel.Check-in was smooth and the reception girl escorted us to the room. Room at the modern spa building was spacious and luxury furnished. There was a big private balcony with sitting area. Hotel is large and has lots of facilities. First we tried lobby bar at the ground floor with outside seating. It serves the largest Aperol Spritz I have ever seen, 400 ml! Hotel has no beach, but there is a paid Medusa beach opposite the road. But do not waste your time (and money) at this beach — sea is not clean, lots of people, you pay for sun bed, you pay for a towel, every one is smoking and you have to breath this smoke. After the beach we went to the hotel’s spa, the pool and even Jacuzzi had seawater. Shame to me that I came to the beach instead of relaxing at hotel pool area free of charge!There are 2 restaurants at the hotel: contemporary and gourmet. We dined at contemporary one and it was fantastic. Great service, reasonable prices, great food with a clever presentation. I found one dish a bit overseasoned (grilled octopus) and I said that to waiter — don’t take me wrong, the dish was really good, but too much salt to my taste. When the bill arrived they didn’t charge overseasoned dish — it does credit to the hotel. The aftermeal drinks at Piano bar and the first floor were just perfect — the tastiest Belinni I have ever tried.Breakfast next morning was served at great ball room in the historical building with huge windows facing the park in front of the hotel. There were everything you may want for breakfast, difficult to list all the items. The hotel definitely worth every euro I sent there.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Incredible stay;5;6.10.2014;I’ve travelled to nearly 40 counties, and I can honestly say this is one of the most impressive hotels I have ever had the pleasure of staying in. The service is top notch from the moment you pull up to the entrance, and the entire hotel is absolutely gorgeous. We stayed in the modern part (there is also a traditional part) and our huge room had a comfortable bed, lots of storage space, a balcony and a large bathroom. It was also very quiet, which we appreciated. While the room itself was fantastic, the amenities are what you should really come for. There is a stunning outdoor pool as well as an indoor one and a hot tub, and THREE saunas that guests can use! We really enjoyed our time in the spa area, which was the perfect way to spend a rainy day. My husband also took advantage of the fantastic gym, which is something that is usually hard to find in Europe.Breakfast the next morning was also incredible, and the fast, free Wi-Fi was also great. Highly recommended!!!;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Top Notch;5;1.10.2014;We traveled with 13 couples and stayed at the Kempiniski as we toured Slovenia and Croatia. Everything was excellent. The hotel had a classic feel while the room was new, clean and well appointed. Our corner room was quiet enough that you couldn't hear the church bells ringing but if needed, the porch allowed them to be heard. The breakfast was a great way to start the day with plenty of options and a stunning dining room and luxurious patio.

Turned in our Rental Car, great customer service;5;19.09.2014;We want to thank the Kempinski Palace for all the help and friendly smiles when we turned in our SIXT rental car. We were not staying there, but the staff was very helpful in showing us the best way to get to Piran and even calling our hotel to let them know we would be there at a certain time to check-in.

Short holiday in September;5;15.09.2014;"The Kempinski Palace is a perfect place to spend few days at this lovely city at Slovenian see. The high standard of Kempinski is guaranteed at this place. The building and rooms are wonderful and it feels modern and traditional at same time. We were at the modern part of the hotel (n237) but I am sure both parts are nice. The breakfast is just perfect - having a good meal outside, almost in the garden is phenomenal. The spa is also fine - we were not supported by the weather but - the sauna place is comfortable and near enough to be in private there and not disturbed by others. This is not the first time in Kempinski for us, but this was one of the best!The staff was great they always try to make your day. (last time Kateryna at reception was so helpful and kindness) Thank you all for your great work there and for the nice \short\"" holiday we had in Slovenia.

The best hotel in the area;5;6.09.2014;Kempinski Palace is by far the best hotel in the area. The Kempinski standards are met in every way. Staff is polite, welcoming and smiling at all times, the rooms are big and comfortable (ours was a superior sea view in the old building) and breakfast buffet was high quality with tons of fruits, meats, fish, cheeses, eggs (made on the spot), cereals, etc. and always fully stocked until 12pm! The saltwater swimming pool is half indoors and half outdoors and is a nice alternative on a hot sunny day since the area does not offer a variety of beautiful beaches. We have tried the Restaurant “Sophia” one night. The environment is elegant and the service impeccable. The wine list was a bit overpriced and the food itself was not to die for. Not value for money according to my opinion. Don’t miss the nearby village Piran. It is gorgeous!!;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Lords in The Palace;5;1.09.2014;A bunch of us (2 oldies and 5 from 19-25), 7 in all, have just spent 8 nights at this hotel. I'm afraid to say that the coffee at breakfast is not perhaps what it might be. The great news is that absolutely everything else was fabulous. The hotel feels like a palace and we were treated, if not quite like royalty, then something not too far removed. The rooms were extremely comfortable and the view from our room was easily one of the best I have ever had and we are reasonably seasoned travellers. I could go on, but it is the staff who make this a great experience. Faultless, committed and extremely hard working.We had originally planned to go to Trieste for a couple of days, but decided to extend our stay at The Kempinski, as long as we could. And we had been to Trieste before. All 7 of us had a ball.Portoroz itself is ok, but no more than that. However, Piran is easily walkable or runable along the coast path and there is plenty of public transport. Piran is a beautiful medieval town (part of Italy until 1954), that made its money off the back of selling salt to the Venetians. It is worth a number of visits. There are plenty of restaurants of all shapes and sizes around and in fact for those who moan about the cost of meals at the Kempinski, I would suggest you just get out of the hotel a bit. Slovenia may not yet be a culinary centre, but it is definitely on its way.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

Checking experience disappointing-I asked receptionist what I can do in the town/hotel until my room will be ready and the answer was simply \I don't know\"". Next disappointing experience was queueing for 25min. to get fried egg for my breakfast (but it happened only during first day of stay = 26/08/14). Very limited choice during night from room-service restaurant (in most 5* hotels in London 90% of menu is available 24/7).""";Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Excellent property and location;5;30.08.2014;This is a fantastic hotel, old school type, located on a lovely palace right across the Mediterranean sea.The indoor/outdoor swimming poll is very hard to resist, but the Mediterranean just across is also worth a dive.The rooms are specious and impeccably decorated.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

Great presentation, too little flavour in coffee;4;30.08.2014;We did not stay at this hotel, we only went there in late morning for a cup of coffee. I must say that, although it was still breakfast time and there were hotel guests eating on the terrace, they served us just coffee with no problems. The service was a bit too anxious as three different waitresses came to our table to ask what we would like to have. Nevertheless, the presentation was really appealing, with cappucino served with lovely muffins on the side, and the apple juice we ordered was also very tasty. However, the cappucino foam was rather bland and not very consitent, really lacking in flavour, which was a bit disappointing. The external and interior decor of this establishment is simply stunning - very beautiful.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Lovely Five Star Hotel;5;29.08.2014;As a family of four we booked two rooms [via Inghams] with a preference that they be as close as possible but we were given one room in the old building a one room in the new building. They did however say one of us could move when a room nearer became available but in the event we both liked our different rooms and decided to stay put despite the distance between us [actually it wasn't difficult to move between rooms via the efficient lifts]. One room had a pleasant view of the hill at the rear of the hotel and a bath, the other had a side view and a walk-in shower instead of a bath, and arguably a better balcony but some noise from the road and a not so nice view. Both rooms had huge beds. Only a small bottle of water is provided on arrival and is not renewed. I thought the mini bar prices were steep but then it is a five star hotel. Breakfast is excellent and served on the terrace [though you can opt to eat inside]. The salt water pool was great and we never had a problem finding sun loungers. The hotel does not allow the reserving of loungers all day, towels are removed if the bed has been unattended for three hours. Personally, I thought that the hotel was the best thing about Portoroz but my wife would disagree on that! Certainly Portoroz is better for children than Piran and there is more space to chill out [soak up the sun]. Anyway, if you want a more interesting place, Piran is only 6 minutes away by frequent bus [fare 1Euro 50 cents] or about 15 minutes on the little land train for just a little more. The best place for either is outside the chemist, just to the left of the hotel [as you face it]. Or of course you can walk to Piran along the coast which is an easy 45 minutes stroll. And the hotel has free wifi too. It has a kids club but we never saw it operate. The evening turndown service makes you feel rather special too.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Real palace with everything;5;26.08.2014;"Definitely one of 5 best hotels I have ever visited. Starting with exterior, really big and dominant building in perfect condition, very nice and clean surroundings.Inside also many clever details like lifts in new building overlooking the spa etc...Spacious De Luxe room in new building with nice balcony overlooking the boulevard and sea. Sleeping quality also high. What I appreciated a lot, was food. No matter if breakfast or dinner, always amazing taste and quality. Of course staff was exceptional in every department, but after several Kempinski stays I finally realized that this is just their standard :)Beach Club Meduza (exclusive beach club for Kempinski guests) is not necessary due to big public beach just across the street, where you can rent umbrella and 2 beds for 17Euro per day. The beach high season occupation is max 50% so no crowd anywhere. If you stay with kids, they appreciate sandy beach and shallow water entrance here. Medusa has only grass and pier so no fun for kids.Another \visit again Kempinski\"" just have been found :)""";Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

Great hotel but beware light sleepers;5;22.08.2014;The hotel is fabulous, the best and most luxurious in Portoroz and Piran, Kempinski knows their thing. However, if you come during summer months, make sure to ask for a room at the back of the hotel overlooking the parking because the bars outside play very loud music until 1am which can be heard with the windows and blinds closed. The hotel has 2 sides: the oldest (but refurbished) side and the new one which has bigger rooms which are very cool and a tad kitsch.

Perfect Vacation, Classy and Beautiful Hotel, Stay Here!;5;17.08.2014;My girlfriend and I stayed for a week vacation at the Kempinski Portoroz. We give 5 stars plus! This is one of the best hotel experiences we have ever had. The highlights for us: - The rooms are spacious, modern, and comfortable. The bathrooms are also a good size. The balcony is spacious. We stayed in the modern part. We loved the room. To add to that, the maid service was always excellent.- The hotel looks like a true palace. It is elegant and luxurious. It is a beautiful sight from outside and every detail is attended to inside.- The hotel concierge Kristijan and his team especially Micha and Peter are professional, caring, and go above and beyond. They took care of us from start to finish so a special thanks! In fact, all the staff were excellent.- Breakfast! The included hotel breakfast from 7-12 has an incredible offering EVEN champagne. Was worth it every morning. If you get Room service, try the Palace Club Sandwich.- Spa: we had a great couple's massage. Was worth every Euro.- Pool: this is one of the best hotel pools we have experienced. Not too crowded, adequate but not overbearing service, comfortable temperature in the salt water pool, jacuzzi, etc. Great to lay out in the sun and relax all day.- the town of Portoroz and surrounding area. Piran is a romantic, beautiful town just 5 minutes away. We also found the drive down the Croatian coast worth the trip.The only points of feedback we have:- the restaurant Sophia left a little to be desired. We enjoyed a romantic dinner in a lovely setting but the guest chef's tasting menu was not up to what we were expecting. We suggest RiziBizi, half way between the hotel and Piran instead.- We were overcharged for parking - but when we asked it was quickly corrected.- the beach in Portoroz is really nothing special. For tourists used to a nice beach, this is NOT it. But we found that the hotel pool as well as beaches in Croatia made up for this. This is obviously not the hotel's fault.Thanks again to the entire staff. This hotel is worth it and we would stay again!;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

Amazing Hotel;5;14.08.2014;Could not fault this hotel in any way, everything is done with great attention to detail and to very high standards. Staff are fantastic, charming and welcoming. We'd single out Carmen on reception and Allen who served drinks pool side, who were particularly friendly and helpful. We went for a three night break and had two rooms in the old part of the building with a park view, which was all very pleasant. We enjoyed night caps in the bar on the terrace and would recommend their house cocktail a Kempinski no.1.

Probably the most luxurious in Slovenia;4;10.08.2014;The Kempinski is a beautifully restored historical hotel linked to a modern annex. Rooms in the annex (where I stayed) are spacious, comfortable and well appointed. They have a large balcony facing the ocean and the pool. As another reviewer said, staff were very professional and not pompous. Breakfast buffet offered a variety of cold and hot dishes. Internet connection worked perfectly. It is very well located and there is a bus stop to Piran right in front of the hotel. On the negative side, I would alert guests that the saltwater swimming pool is a bit small for the number of guests and may be hard to find a place in the sun. Parking is not free either. And, although it is a beach resort, there is no beach service in the hotel. So if you really want to go to the beach you must use the beach club opposite (which you also have to pay for).;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

Excellent service;5;2.08.2014;Overall this is a good choice if you want to feel pampered on holiday! We had a room facing the park on the fourth floor and were quite happy with this choice. We did find it strange though that all the balconies only had one chair on them. The other minus points are lack of daily complimentary bottle of water, no tea/coffee-making facilities, and the chage for parking. The pool is really good - you can actually swim in it. The breakfast is by far the best we've ever had. I doubt if we'd return because Portoroz itself is not the ideal holiday venue for us and I'm not 100% convinced that the price the hotel charges is totally warranted. During our midweek stay at the end of July there was no entertainment - everything seemed to be organised for weekends or August.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

There is big indoor and outdoor pool with sea water, and it is really super, because there is no good beach in Portoroz (my opinion).

Best Hotel and Best Value in Slovenia;5;30.07.2014;"For a luxury traveler \best hotel and best value\"" often don't go hand in hand but I am happy to say that this is the case at the Kempinski Palace Portoroz. Great location, lovely gardens, nice selection of restaurants (all with good food) and BEAUTIFULLY renovated rooms. Everything is so luxurious- the gorgeous marble bathrooms, the sumptuous fabrics, the deep and cozy beds... I could go on but you get the picture and no detail has been missed. I kept looking around wondering how they could make money with such a wonderful property charging so little. In most world beach resorts you'd pay much more for much less.

amazing hotel;5;21.07.2014;the quality, service and accommodation live up to the 5* standards, perfectly located in the centre of Portorozthe breakfast choice is amazing as well as the hotel pool and its facilitiesthe only things I'd complaint about is the wallet parking which i do not personally like cause I feel much comfortable parking my car on my own and the beach service in nearby meduza clubit's little ridiculous that it's not included in room rate but you have to pay extra 20 euros per day per person also the service at the reception was little slow considering we arrived in June (during peak season)otherwise I'd definitely recommend the hotel;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Beautiful property - some service weakness at this price;3;19.07.2014;"We booked a suite at the last minute for a couple of days in high season at a pretty high price tag. We had been used to very good Kempinski service in Munich and other locations during an extended European driving vacation so we had anticipated a similar experience in Portoroz.Our \Rose Suite\"" overlooking the pool was smallish but Ok for the price and season.At check-in we found the suite to be plagued with a heavy musty/spicy odour so we asked for a replacement room. No alternate rooms were available so after a few hours we were satisfied that housekeeping was able to remedy the smell.After returning to our room while waiting for it to be freshened up and wanting a fresh shower we were surprised to discover no soap in the suite and a towel shortage. Later, in the midst or an international call and needing to jot down some notes, I find no paper or pen in the desk.Calls to the front desk resolved each of these issues in very short order but still a disappointment at this price point.Also, no waters were provided at bed turn-down which is very, very disappointing in a hotel suite of this calibre and price. Otherwise we found the property very much to our liking.Note that the sea view rooms at the front of the hotel may be exposed to some late night party noise from the beach bars across the street.""";Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
How kind personnel can be !!!;5;18.07.2014;In het Nederlands gezegd: ik was echt wel fantastisch blij met de service. I was delighted. People worked in the hotel as if it wat their own. People were disciplined, OK, but they kept their own style. Staff was devoted to Kempinsky while staying who they are and serving us as a client in the best possible way. Especially Simona from the massage and Theresa from the Stradivaria rock concept struck us. But above all, Bori, from Hungaria, the most exciting waitress we ever met as a family, wat a real experience. How she managed to serve the intrest of the hotel, combine that with a personal touch towards the client (us) and stay authentic in the woman she is, enthousiastic about what she does and in te mean time customizing the service to the client: waw. She is representative to the feeling we (myself, my wife and my three children (22 , 19 and 16 years old) have of Kempinsky and the Slovenian way of treating customers: great.

Verging on the exemplary;5;10.07.2014;We had a fabulous week at the Palace hotel. We were in the new section ,on the second floor with a large ,well equipped room facing the sea and overlooking the pool area and the Fleur de Sel restaurant. We ate in that restaurant twice and whilst they were the most expensive meals of our holiday,the food and service were faultless. We always took breakfast in the Chandelier room which is magnificent - lovely high ceilings ,stuccoed walls . You could imagine royal balls taking place there in the past ! Most people took breakfast on the Terrace, which ,whilst lovely, meant a long trek to the buffet. Having said that the breakfast selection was massive and of very high quality.We did feel that a lot of space is underused -especially the Chandelier room. It should be the premier room of the hotel,not for a few people at breakfast. Reception staff were very helpful. We particularly enjoyed taking pre dinner drinks n one of the balconies off the piano room on the mezzanine floor(facing the sea. )I'm glad we chose this hotel which ticked all the right boxes;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

Loved it!;5;25.06.2014;We had a week in the Kempinski and loved it! Now back to work, back home walking the dog in the rain, cooking my own food and making my own bed, I appreciate the luxury we enjoyed all the more.The hotel consists of the original. sumptuously fitted out building with a new extension attached which contains the spa and pool as well as some upgraded rooms with large balconies and a restaurant with outdoor balcony.We had a deluxe park view room, in the new part, which was huge with a wrap around balcony containing pots of scented jasmin. The bathroom was pretty spacious and the service was indeed impeccable with rooms serviced twice a day. Breakfast was typical of what I've seen in 5 stars with the addition of Slovenian bubbly available with fresh strawberries which is a great way to start the day! The crystal room is beautiful. There was a private function when we were there and when we passed the chandeliers glittered and the glasswork shone like something you see in a movie.We ate in the Sophia restaurant (twice) and we had a table set up on the lawn after a glass of champage in Bubbles. The whole experience was so special thanks to the excellent staff. The food in the hotel was easily the best we had over the week.How can I last until my next visit?!!!!;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

just awesome;5;24.06.2014;well, that is the Hotel. and that is what a 5-stars hotel should be. good location, though across the street from the sea. impeccable service, brilliant interiors. we had a huge suit with an even more spacious terrace with a jacuzzi right on the terrace. the pool area is also very nice. the gym is tiny, surprisingly tiny for such a large building, but the rest was so marvelous, that this small gym wasn't a big deal;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Nice but unprofessional and misleading;3;23.06.2014;"We have stayed 3 nights in this Kempinski Hotel. The price of the hotel would be okay, if you would get, what you have payed for.While checking in, we have experienced many problems, which are shocking for this kind of property. We have explicitely booked room with balcony and sea view. We have been told upon arrival, that there are no rooms with balcony available. How can this happen, if you book and pay your room in advance?! How can Kempinski sell the rooms, if they don't have them? After almost 1 hour of trying to find sollution, we have been given a room on 1st flor with \trees view\"" and something they call \""french balcony\"" about 50cm wide. No chairs, no table. So you cannot enjoy the view. But who cares, on 1st floor there's no view at all anyways. This was a huge disapointment, as I know, they had more rooms available, as our friends arrived later, and have been given an upgrade to suites with 2 balconies on 3rd floor! I felt really cheated. Other weird thing - we have asked to provide an iron, to iron some shirts we needen, they told us, its not possible and we were forced to give them to house keeping and payed about 40 Euro for few shirts and pair of jeans to get pressed. I kind of hoped, they will not charge us for this after messing up our reservation and giving us crap rooms, but I was mistaken.Other room facilities are okay, rooms are properly cleaned. Pool and wellness area very small! Breakfast was okay, but if you are eating on the terrace, and leave your table for a minute or two to get some more stuff, the birds will make a mess on your table immediately.I wouldn't stay here again, Not only the hotel cheated us, but did not offer any compensation at all. I am very disapointed by Kempinski Palace in Portoroz, as they do not live up their standards they are famous for.""";Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

Apartment has 2 rooms, one big toilet, small wc, very spacious antre and the best part...approximately 80m2 terrace with jacuzzi.

A Tumultous Period?;4;6.06.2014;Six years ago when this beautiful jewel in the crown of Slovenian hotels was finally completely refurbished and upgraded, its atmosphere was somewhat too presumptuous and dignified. However, it was a truly remarkable hotel with perfect service and imperial splendor. The only bothering issue at the time was a ridiculuous drinks markup.Now something has changed during the last two years, the reason for my review update. It is well known that the local owners, facing bankruptcy, are trying desperately to sell at EUR 40 million, having invested well above a hundred. No money, no funny. The clientelle is different at the first glance, thanks to truly formidable discounts via some booking systems. Fittingly, the rose garden is partly unprunned, there is no water in a lovely system of connected miniature ponds, personnel in the pool area is hard to find and not overly attentive. Water in the pool is kept at regrettable 24 degrees, same as the air around the interior part of the pool. Cold. The hotel, even though quite full, gave the impression of a ghost hotel with shops deserted, and some of the all too numerous bars closed.Our check-in was friendly and quick, but with flaws for the first time. Room was fine, though far less spacious than one might be led to believe considering the 5-star DeLuxe level. Sizeable bathroom. The mattress showed its age through a visible depression left by too many bodies, and was consequently far from what we were used to previously. A small spider's web above the TV was an interesting fringe benefit.Obviously the cost containment measures went all too far also regarding service. As I am slightly familar with the Kempinski protocols, I was appalled. Nobody to sit you for breakfast (the host's desk is very obviously there, but nobody around, so people waited in vain before taking the initiative in their own hands), tables were set in the very simplest possible way, no smile on personnel's faces, a young lady with an extremely annoyed face who brought us cappuccinos simply put them down between us (!) with a bang... How completely different from the previous time two years ago, when everything was smooth and perfect, if not warm and friendly.Current hotel cuisine keeps tradition of the German style fine cooking and is surely one of the best three in Portorož. Fine, but not a major achievement. Unheated plates for a warm course during a serious dinner are not something I would ever expect and understand. Furthermore, markups for beverages remain a disgrace to the management and a turn-off for the guest. The excellent French patisseur and the previous German chefs have all left together with the management's ambition to create a truly remarkable hotel for the most distinguishing guest.It surely still is one of the Slovenia top hotels, No 1 or 2, but this says more about the level of the rest of the pack. Thereagain, the previouos very high level has gone down in each and every respect. I regret that. Even though I am sure that the hotel will feel very different during the traditional BMW days, it is none of my concern. I hope a new ownership will restore the splendor.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Expected just a bit more;4;2.06.2014;The hotel is without a doubt a very good one. However, under the name Kempinski I expected perfection, and this was not always achieved. The rooms are big enough, big bathroom and lovely balcony (we stayed in a modern part of the hotel), however the air-con did not work properly. After first hot night of bad sleep I complained about the temperature and the thermostat to one of the staff who came to the room, but he said those were the fixed settings of the hotel. Only at the checkout the reception mentioned that they could have done something about it, if they had known the problem. Three nights of not really good sleep. One night we tried with the balcony door open, but that night the drunken youth were shouting and singing somewhere not so far from the hotel so this option was also off. The bed pillows were also not worthy the 5star hotel. Breakfast was not very well organised. At the entrance there is a sign for you to register and wait to be seated. This was actually done the first day, the other days no one was there (once we naively waited there for some minutes before we figured out that nobody cares). I had to constantly ask for bread baskets (available first day only), one day we had to wait quite long for them to bring tea jars and teacups to make a tea... Which was pity because the serving staff that waited the tables outside on the terrace were absolutely wonderful, kind and attentive, as were a lot of other hotel personnel. The spa and pool area is great and the beach is just across the street - excellent location. All in all, if they can really solve the air conditioning problem in each room, we will probably come back.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

Just a 30-minute drive from Trieste, a beautiful italian city and also very close from Croatia.The hotel itself is very comfortable, with a beautiful ballroom and two very good restaurants. The spa is awesome. The pool, half indoors, half outdoors is great for anyone who likes to swim laps. The staff is friendly and multi-lingual.On the improvable side: no coffee-tea making facilities in the rooms, random opening hours in the shopping gallery.

Great Hotel on a beautiful location;4;13.05.2014;I spent there 2 nights right after Easter in this really great hotel in Portoroz. They offer excellent services and a top breakfast, which offers a very wide selection of everything, making the start into the day very promising. We had one of the luxury rooms in the older part of this Grand Hotel, offering a perfect overview over the beach.The SPA area is nearly perfect, only we missed a separate area on the beach (or we just heve not found it, anyway the weather was not so perfect as the hotel was . . .);Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Good place but be careful if the hotel is crowded;4;13.05.2014;I spent 3 nights in this place in May 14, in a standard room in the new building, facing the old one. Room is nice, bed is large and comfortable. Bathroom is nice, with shower and bathtub. Cleanliness was perfect.Breakfast is very good and there is lots of choices to make you happy. Unfortunately, no fresh juice is offered, you have to do it yourself. Croissants were not very good and didn't sound from the morning. The hotel has two sea water pool, an outdoor one and an indoor one. Service was very pool at the pool area: no one to welcome you, give you towels and prepare your chair. It was disturbing, as if nobody cares! Chairs are not numerous, so if the hotel is a bit crowded, I guess the pool area will turn into a battlefield.Fitness room is very small but is enough to make some exercise. Space is limited so be careful if the hotel is crowded.To sum up, comfortable place and quiet but be careful if the hotel is crowded, amenities are not made to satisfy every guest. Note the Portoroz is not a very interesting place : beach is poor, the only interesting thing to see is Piran, very close to Portoroz. ;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

strange management;3;15.04.2014;"The staff is kind and well trained so far. The place itself is one of the prettiest in the whole area for sure.Therefore it is really disappointing after having booked my room for 7 nights (deluxe) and for my daughter with her boyfriend for 5 nights (superior) that my daughter was given a small room in the \historical\"" part which was a bit run down. After she disagreed with this room she was said the hotel is fully booked. At this time I was out, so I complained by phone and after 20 minutes she was able to change room to the modern part close to my room. What she was not informed about was that the room was a smoker room, what is disgusting for no smokers. So I had to intervene a second time the following day and a correct room according to our booking was provided.May be because of the age of 24 years the. receptionist is advised to fill the less nice rooms to such young guests. As we arrived with two cars we liked to go out in one car one evening therefore I left my car after loading my bicycles in front of the entrance after having been advised by the door boy to park it that way and went up to my room after no carboy was available to park the car in the garage. I called down to ask to bring the other car to use for the evening.I received a call from the manager personally commanding me arrogantly to come down to remove my car immediately. Paying 40 bucks for two cars and being corrected that way made me feel not like guest but like an employee. I assume it is not my job to look for the carboy. The staff is really kind but the manager could learn from his staff a lot.Michael Guth Munich""";Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Wowed at a new European favourite hotel for us and Slovenia's very best;5;8.04.2014;As exceptionally fortunate and frequent travellers to Europe, we have a number of very favourite hotels in Europe including Hotel Alfonso VII in Seville, the Bretagne in Athens, Prince De Galle in Paris and San Domenico Palace in Taomina however we have now a new favourite.From arrival with immediate assistance with luggage and valet parking to a seamless fast check in, we felt immediately welcomed and valued as guests of the Kempinski Palace.Our room was a deluxe room in the new wing with a sea view and balcony. It was large, well appointed, cleverly designed ( a frequent whinge of mine is suitcase storage- well catered here) and oozed luxury. Don't skimp and miss the sea view with a view also over the pool area and sunsets.Breakfast was another hedonistic delight on a sun soaked terrace in front of the majestic old wing - great selections including perfectly fresh produce presented by wonderful staff. Added bonuses were a late noon finish to breakfast allowing plenty of time and lessening the guilt of that glass or two of prosecco!Pre dinner drinks in the main bar ( across the 'air bridge' connecting the 2 wings) was another event we embraced with gusto - whether taken in the elegant and refined in the main area or on the terraces, service was sophisticated and bespoke and pricing more than fair.Regrettable we did not have an opportunity to enjoy the other and numerous eating and drinking options such as the 'bubbles' room or Sophia's.The staff were simply exemplary at every interaction and reflect extremely well on managementEverything about our stay was almost perfect - in fact if searching for any negatives , and the first will sound petty, my only gripes were the course recycled toilet tissue and the second being the day pool man whose job description is apparently limited to 'watching' only guests shuffle pool lounges and grapple with umbrellas.We will be back and next time for a much longer stay!;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

A good place to stay but forget the dining;4;1.12.2013;"The location and building are superb. A place you simple like to stay with on top of that the warm welcome and perfect reception with full attention to detail. Rooms and facilities are according the standards and value for money. To go short.. perfect for a stay.The dining was a disaster; an old fashioned business model based on formalities, long waiting, small portions and high pricing in a rich atmosphere. Lack of a good feeling among the staff and clearly trained in servicing people according a fixed template. Also the quality of the food is poor.Bottom line;; stay there but go a few steps outhouse for dining";Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
EXCELENT!!!;5;11.11.2013;Stayed here for 3 days with my wife, and after reading all the comments we had high expectations about the hotel, and it didnt disapoint! Rooms are spacious, everything was quality made in the whole hotel, breakfast was included and it was fabulouse, with all kind of food to choese from. Went to lunch in a hotel's restaurant, and had one of the best stakes i have had in a while. Only problem to me was cold water in swimming pool, and very expencive mini bar. Everything else was better than expected. Will definitly plan to come back again!;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Do Yourself A Favour...;5;10.11.2013;And stay in this hotel, it is worth your while. On arrival we asked if we could have another room with more light, which was possible, not one was shown to us, but several. Overall, nice decor, centrally located, friendly staff, spa facilities were good and modern, great outdoor swimming pool, room colourful and tastefully designed, spacious bathroom (room 437), breakfast was certainly one of the best we have ever experienced, very nice breakfast hall (during the weekend it can get crowded), and because breakfast was served till noon, you could have a quiet moment at the terrace in front of the hotel, reading your paper and 'recovering' from great breakfast choices. We stayed here in October, Portoroz is very quiet then, when we went out at night to have dinner in a restaurant (or in Piran), we were often the only ones there. Mostly elderly crowd (Eastern Europe, Germans, Austrians) during that time of year, autumn. Car park at the hotel takes 18 euros a day, in front of the hotel 12. Kempinski, great brand!

Good place in Portoroz;5;2.11.2013;We stay here 1st time in april during E holiday for 3 days and it was for us amazing. Our next visit was in Sept. For 3 day and again no problem. Realy best hotel in town. Good spacious rooms with wifi and sea wiew breakfast from 7 till 12 with plenty of choice. Fast service.On evening we try spa an was nice place for relax. This is best place where to go for a short 3 days relax with wife in Portoroz.Recomended. We was in old part of hotel and it was nice room with history inside.

Best hotel in the region;5;26.10.2013;Travelling with three friends.The hotel was easy to find and had valet parking. Reception was a bit 'modern' for my taste: two low desks where you are invited to sit while being checked in. I can imagine it being a bit of a nightmare to check in or out if a coach party arrives just before you. From arriving at the hotel the staff were very friendly and very professional: a credit to the Kempinski name. My room was in the new wing of the hotel and I believe that these are the best rooms. I asked (and was given) a park-view room as these are the quietest in the hotel. A friend and a sea-view room and noted that he could hear the music from the bars very clearly (he solved that problem by staying in the bars until they shut!).The bar in the hotel is very good and up to the usual Kempi standards. Their breakfast though demands a special mention. Breakfast is served until 12:00. This is very civilised indeed and the rest of the Kempinski chain should follow suit! The quality of the breakfast was also excellent with a very wide selection of cold meats, fresh fruit, pastries, breads, cereals and the usual hot items with omelettes, poached eggs, eggs benedict all being available from the chef. The gym was small and the cardio equipment was good quality. For weights they had a very limited selection of machines and a reasonably selection on free weights. There is also a good swimming pool (and an outside pool)Considering the price, I found this to be a faultless hotel and would happily stay there again and recommend it to my friends.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
The adress for portoroz;4;8.10.2013;I ve been there to attend a meeting, the hotel is excellent and the service was very friendly. There still are things you don t expect in a five stars hotel, insect nets (outside the hotel near the glass wall), small rooms and slippery bath tub. I asked twice to get my shirts pressed. Also for people going there please beware of the revolving door as you might get your head hit if you get into it from the right angle.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Cramped;1;5.10.2013;We booked a suite and arrived in anticipation as this was our first experience with a Kempinski Hotel, we normally stay at Aman Resorts or St. Regis properties and are very frequent travellers. There was supposed to be a complimentary bottle of sparkling wine on arrival it was not there after asking for it on three occasions it finally arrived.The suite??? was small and the bathroom cramped so if two people were in the bathroom at one time you were bumping into each other all the time. The shower was something that I would relate to a Accor Formula One not a supposedly five star property. During the night the room was hot and stuffy with the air-conditioning not working, I contacted the Duty Manager and he was all apologies and said he would get us a larger suite and have the air-conditioning looked at, nothing came of this and I again had to make contact. This time I was told that all other suites had been booked out, mind you I had made this reservation three weeks prior. I was told the air-conditioning had been adjusted, however this was not the case and we had to open all the doors leading outside to cool the room down, this however gave us more grief with the traffic noise from the road. Sorry but if this is a typical Kempinski property, then it will be our last. For the persons expecting a suite to the standards they usually expect you will not find it here. Not a cheap room by any standard being charged 338 Eu. per night, sorry not for us.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Ask for a sea view, in the new section;4;30.09.2013;We had a large seaview room in the original section of the hotel. The original architecture failed to capitalize on the views, and our room had two small double doors to a narrow Juliette balcony. Colleagues in the new section had a balcony to step out on but slightly smaller room. Comfortable bed, good mini bar, excellent buffet breakfast, and a superb pool complex with a well equipped small gym above. Staff were solemnly efficient. We were staying at the end of the season so the whole resort was quiet. Conference facilities and catering were very adequate for our meetings. I'd return for a short stay in luxury.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
The best choice for Portorož;4;25.09.2013;The Kempinski Portorož is where the quality is. The superb location: the promenade, local cousine restos, bars and shops are just at front of the hotel. We enjoyed the pool and spa area. The breakfast is abundant and healthy. My negative experience refers to the hotels's night turn down service (which is a kind of lightweight) and ignorant reception staff (they sent me to the business center which is inoperative);Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Absolutely Perfect;5;25.09.2013;Spent 3 nights at this hotel. Absolutely stunning. The service is great, the food is great, the rooms are spacious. I stayed in the modern part of the hotel.

Superb breakfast, very good sleep;5;16.09.2013;I spent 3 nights in this hotel. I slept on the 2nd floor in a double room in the old wing of the hotel. The quality of sleep is guaranteed. The mattress is awesome-wide, cushions are soft - or hard - you find both. The bathroom was very spacious. If I really need to find something, then the divisor glass of the shower could be a little bit longer to cover the rest of the bathroom from the water, but this is really not THAT disturbing (maybe if you use the bathroom in two in the same moment, you MIGHT get wet if one takes the shower and the other one is sitting on the loo, so you see..I had to make up a situation).Breakfast is just brilliant. They have such a good assortment of cereals, fruit. Warm or cold breakfast...Here also just one thing: when the balcony is full of guests, it might take a while to get a coffee - this is one thing, you can't prepare on your own, but you have to order it from the staff. It might be a good idea to have one person always there, who takes the orders.Friends, who tried the spa were delighted.I absolutely would come back anytime and suggest you to choose this place, if you are around.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Perfect hotel but the beach!;4;15.09.2013;Perfect hotel - everything new, clean, very friendful staff (night boy even opened all hotel shops to find a swimming suit!). Pool was perfect - with salt water. The only drawback - the beach, which is not the hotel property, - small and a bit dirty. But if you relax only at the pool, than that's the best choise!;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Nearly Perfect;5;14.09.2013;Stayed 6 nights in deluxe rooms at the front of the hotel with sea facing balconies (rooms 306 & 310). The hotel is majestic and almost flawless with great facilities, and cleanliness and service throughout is first class. We enjoyed the sumptuous breakfasts which are served in an opulent crystal ball room, or on the outside veranda. The swimming pool and jacuzzi areas are spacious and immaculately maintained. Portoroz itself is a reasonable location, with good coastal walking and a selection of restaurants/bars/shops, but we spent the evenings in neighbouring Piran, which is a small, but beautiful and impressive medieval town set on a peninsula, and a real jewel on the Adriatic coast. We had great fish meals at Pri Mari and Pavel which we highly recommend. We walked in a few times along the pretty coastal path, and other times we took the reliable local bus which leaves from outside the Kempinski every 15 minutes, and costs about €1 each way.The only downside we experienced was two consecutive disturbed nights on the Friday and Saturday due to extremely loud music at the front of the hotel which continued until around 2am each night (on one occasion from a bar opposite the hotel, and on the other occasion from a function at the hotel, almost directly under our room). Those wanting a guaranteed peaceful life might be advised to choose a park view room, away from the hotel's function room. Despite this blip, the overall experience was highly enjoyable and we strongly recommend the hotel.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Beautiful Hotel;4;13.09.2013;I spend six days in Kempinski Palace and really loved the hotel. The rooms were clean and service was excellent.

The hotel is fantastic, nearly perfect on a measure where perfection exists only in theory;5;30.08.2013;I have seen the complains in some of the previous reviews about the long waiting times and the hotel is being overcrowded. At the end of august I experienced none of these. We always had a table to eat at, and a poolside sunbed to lying on.The hotel is fantastic, nearly perfect on a measure where perfection exists only in theory. And believe me it is not easy to impress me. I could try to describe with a dozen words how helpful and friendly the staff was but again perfect is the most suitable word. They easily and instantly solved every problem/request we had... if we had.We got our room in the modern part. It was spacious even with an extra bed for our little son. The furniture is well-designed and luxurious... we had a nice balcony as well. We loved the bathroom especially when we had to gone there during the first overnight and realized that the marble floor is heated to be nice and warm for your barefoot. Wow! They check and clean the room multiply times a day so it was absolutely spotless.The wellness unit of the hotel is very nice. I have spent an hour or more there every single day. The pools are filled with sea water (salty). The hotel has no direct beach connection you need to cross a road and the promenade to reach the sea. We haven't tried the dedicated Kempinski beach (extra 20EUR per person per day) because there were lots of free spots on the public beaches. It you need the sunbed and the sunshade on the beach you can still rent it everywhere for 5-10EURs.It is not easy to find any shortcoming in this hotel. If I try hard I can enumerate only two:- while I got my breakfast the tables should have been cleaned by my used plates more frequently- the extra bed is very confortable but it was a little bit creaky;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

The bad is very comfortable (not too soft and not too hard). The bathroom is really magnificant. The pool is small, but anyway it's nice and u can find a good space to lay down.

Perfect as always!;5;27.08.2013;We have been there many times and it still is perfect. The service is good, rooms are clean and nice. The spa area is beautiful and relaxing. Pool is a bit small, but it´s OK. Tip: don´t have dinner at the hotel, there is a perfect restaurant just the opposite of the hotel, you don´t see it at first, but you can see it from the beach. It was called Porto del mar Portorož (https://www.facebook.com/pages/Porto-del-mar-Portoro%C5%BE/391006474295371). The food is just to die for, we are so sad that we discovered that place just 2 days before we left the hotel, wish we would have eaten there the whole week.

Beautiful hotel but when full the service and comfort lack;4;26.08.2013;"We stayed in this hotel twice. Both times we were very impressed by the architecture and how much the old and new work together. During our first stay we got a double room in the old part. It was quite spacious even with family it didn't feel stuffed. This year we got a bigger room in the new part and it was stunning with! We got a big balcony with a nice park and street/sea view. The rooms service does a great job.What we loved about this hotel most was the breakfast. First - it was offered until 12 pm and as late sleepers we enjoyed it very much. Second - the breakfast terrace is just gorgeous! And last but not least - the breakfast choice was great, a lot of fresh fruit and vegetables, fresh juices, lots of cereals, choice of different milk, pastry... There is just one thing I object- the kids area in the breakfast restaurant is situated next to the food bars which are quite far from the tables. We would appreciate a play area on the terrace so we can see the kids and the kids can see us. The hotel staff was very helpful and nice, we cannot complain at all.BUTAs written in the heading of the review, the 5star luxury lost the charm when the hotel was full. We were waiting for the pancakes for the kids for 30 - 40 minutes. The cook was nervous and snappy. The pool area was completely full. It is definitely too small for the size of the hotel. Since the beach and the sea in Portoroz is not very nice you choose the pool over the beach if you can. On the last day of our stay some technical problem occured and the pool area was closed. We were adviced to go the private beach but it was so full that there was no space for towels even on the concrete sidewalk. Nothnig luxurious about this beach, really. We chose to stay on the public beach and it was much better. This year we were also surprised that the beach area was not as clean as we expected from a five star hotel. We stayed at the sunbeds over the corner (not in the main pool area) and on the floor were stubs and dirt from other guests. There were also \hidden\"" broken sunbeds and umbrellas - somehow they forgot that there are still sunbeds for guests that are still occupied. We would still recommend the hotel but if you can, choose a low season to travel.""";Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Nice bulding, good location - bt that's more or less it;3;26.08.2013;We stayed in the hotel for three nights. Even though the location and the architecture of the bulding itself are great, the quality of service was quite a bit of disappointment and certainly not at the level you would expect from a Kempinsky hotel. Maybe because the hotel was full, but breakfast table was difficult to get, coffee orders took half an hour to serve and breakfast staff (mostly interns?) looked very, very stressed each morning. Additionally, getting a place in the pool area was nearly impossible and the water was realy cold. One would normally not expect these hassles in this price range.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Not worth the kempinski label;1;24.08.2013;"I am amused by people praising the hotel for its cleanliness. Yes, it was clean, but that's about it. I expect a bit more than \just clean\"" from Kempinski. The hotel was quite full so it may be part of the problem but such a brand should manage even at full capacity. Pool seats inaccessible, breakfast table 10min waiting time, eggs 25min waiting time, coffee 35min waiting time. Staff failed to mention that the Kempinski beach costs extra 20eur per person. Not a problem if you always carry a wallet but a bit of a pain if you walk there in your bathing suit and have to turn around. It's not that close. Also, considering you already pay 300+ eur, and it's a beach hotel, the beach could actually be included. Portoroz is quite ugly with lots of strange casino-junkies floating around. If you want nice, go to Piran, or even better, go somewhere else, to a more service-oriented country.""";Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

Five star Luxury Hotel lacks basics;3;17.08.2013;We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights.I stayed with my wife and 2 of my kids. Although we booked in advance the hotel was not able to book us 2 rooms on the same floor.For sure this hotel is a good hotel but claiming to be a 5 star luxury hotel you expect accommodation and service close to perfection.First of all the basics of a good hotel are he room and the bathroom. The room (we had a superior room) was ok and airco was working very nicely, housekeeping was excellent. The bathroom is one of the smallest bathrooms I have ever seen. It is about 2m2 by 2m2 with a bath, toilet and bidet all in the same space, Being with 2 persons in the bathroom is impossible. The bathroom has no shower. Unless you consider the hand sprinkler which is positioned in the bath at approximately 1m80 as a shower. Being taller than 6 feet I could sit on my knees washing my hair. When I complained about this to the reception asking them to buy a tube which is 15 centimeter longer, they told me I could take a normal shower at the spa.The bathroom being so small makes it a dangerous place. The door handle is rectangular (very nice art decco style) but with sharp edgy sides. I can not imagine how many people must have hurt themselves on this handles.Next basic in a hotel is the food.The breakfast is ok but far from outstanding. Some people may be overwhelmed by the champagne and strawberries but I prefer to get a cup of thee. Getting the thee was far more difficult. An antique looking water heather had to be filled with water constantly by staff. Which they only did when you asked for, during 4 days I had to ask 3 times and come back later 5 minutes to get some simple thee.In the evening you can eat at the lovely terasse in front of the hotel with ocean view. Except when too many people who are not staying at the hotel have made a reservation.They kindly say they are overbooked and you have to eat inside making you feel like second choice. It even gets worse when there is a wedding at the hotel. They put you in a place called gentleman's club which is not even listed as being one of the hotel restaurants.Besides these incidents the food was excellent. Except for the third day we only started to eat at 9 PM and got our main course around 10 PM. The risotto was overcooked and the turkey to dry. For sure due to the fact we were so late.... So one good advice start your diner no later than I would say 8 PM.The first day when we ate at the restaurant I had to ask specifically to get the wine card. The wine was overcharged and the average wine on the menu was around 100€. So we ordered an average local wine.The waiter did not let us taste the wine but immediately pored half of the bottle in 2 glasses.But I may sound negative so I repeat the food at the restaurant is excellent.Next basic element for an hotel is the swimming pool. Forget about the swimming pool. There are only about 80 sunbeds in this hotels and when at full capacity I believe 400 guests. So forget to get a sunbed unless you are an early bird willing to put your towels on the chairs early in the morning. In the hotel there are different warnings staff may take of your belongings from the sunbeds if yu are absent for more than 20 minutes. This only shows the importance of the problem and off course staaf never takes your belongings away. In for days we could only sit by the pool around 6 PM. this is a magic moment, people are leaving the swimming pool, you can start to understand why the designer wanted to make a tiny swimming pool. But 6 PM is also the time when the mosquito's start to be very active. Be sure to have some mosquito repellent protection or you will get nasty bites. And do not stay to long at the pool as you need to get in the restaurant preferably before 8 PM.No place at the swimming pool. No problem you can go to the 5 star luxury beach called Medusa. Only 150 m away from the hotel. As you are a guest of the hotel (4 other hotels give the same privilege) they only charge you 20€ per person. Most of the people in slovenia consider being at the beach as putting their towel on the concrete and getting a sun tan. So being on a sunbed on a small strip of grass (or something that looks like grass during the rain season) near the sea could be called a 5 star luxury beach and you feel privileged to pay only 20€. I have to say the grilled prawns i ate at the Medusa restaurant were excellent.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Excelent hotel - but in the wrong place?;4;16.08.2013;We arrived by car and was promptly greeted upon arrival. Check-in process went smoothly and our luggage as well as car was taken care of. The hotel have a beautiful interior, quite classical and not overwhelming. It suits the hotels architecture splendidly. We had booked a superior room with sea view. The room was on the 4th floor in the old building of the hotel. The size of the room was OK, dominated by the very pleasant bed. Room were clean and tidy upon arrival and it stayed so throughout our 4 night stay. We did indeed have a nice view of the Adriatic from our window, but more of that in a moment. There were an excellent breakfast buffet. The hotel was quite full, but we never had any problems finding a nice table out on the terrace. Waiters were busy, yet they were able to bring coffee promptly, and clean up tables when people left. We did not try any a la carte dishes for breakfast. We did spend some time by the pool which is salt water. We never had any problem getting sun beds. Service at the pool bar were good and prompt. We dined at both of the restaurants of the hotel, Fleur de Sel and Sophia, see separate reviews of them.The downside is Portoroz. From our view of the Adriatic we had to see over a shanty town of small restaurants, ice cream parlours and bars - some of them karaoke bars. Some of the bars played music till 3 o'clock in the morning, and although the sound isolation of our room was good, it was not possible to shut this music completely out. In fairness to Portoroz I must say that the sea looked very clean, and access to the sea was easy and free.It may be unfair to award this hotel 5 points because of things outside the control of the hotel in itself, but this was a part of our whole experience. The hotel in itself is however definitely worth 6 points.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Best hotel in Slovenia;5;14.08.2013;This is by far the best hotel in Slovenia - I highly recommend this hotel to anyone that is passing by. The rooms are clean, modern and comfortable, the breakfast was amazing (lots of choice, from healthy options to indulging pancakes - fantastic!), and the staff are polite and friendly - worthy of the Kempinski name. I feel I can say this because I am Slovenian, but Slovenia is not known for its luxury and definitely lacks it, so coming across this hotel was like finding a needle in a haystack. I'll definitely be back.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Lovely place to stay;5;13.08.2013;"Slovenia and Portoroz are well kept secrets in the United States market. The Kempinski palace was luxurious without feeling snobby. The staff were consistently friendly and always helpful. The food in the breakfast buffet and restaurants was excellent. Everything was spotless. The pool is beautiful and the area around it clean. The WIFI worked well. I found that Portoroz was \user friendly\"" as a tourist. Most people in the shops speak English. There are multiple gelato stands on the main drag. The view of the Adriatic from our room was picturesque. I am very allergic to mold and detected none in the hotel. AC worked well and there was a topper on the mattress making for a very comfortable bed.""";Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

Wonderful place to Stay;4;3.08.2013;This apartment centre is just a perfect place to stay. It is close to everything and just 3 km from Piran which is a wonderful little fishing village. Get the bus to Piran as they do no permit cars to enter. Bus leaves from close to the marina complex. The apartments are very modern well serviced with all needed and air con.

smart and casual;5;2.08.2013;excellent hotel for holiday in Portoroz. Concierge is efficient and answers to all demand within a few minutes. Breakfast is generous with quality products. Staff is helpful and kind. Clientele is casual. The beach is 200 meters apart from the hotel, it is, in fact, a paved pier with a grass area. There is room enough for everybody and even if it is a little expensive it is worth the price. Service is efficient in the beach area. The salted pool is big enough and service around it efficient too.

Excellent stay;5;29.07.2013;Will start with the not so good..no direct beach access and crowded pool.But those are about the only bad things i can come up with.Main restaurant is really good,as we stayed there for 6 days i was a bit concerned about the menu,it seemed a little limited.This in fact was not the case,every day the manager Mr Stojan Babic would have new suggestions for us.And even beyond that,some of us just explained what we would like and the chef would try and create that for us.Also had some lunch at Fleur de Sel and that was excellent aswell,really friendly staff,very helpfull[thank you Daniel,Joe and Winnie]All in all a very nice place,maybe less so for those who really want peace and quiet.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Rest & Relaxation!;5;26.07.2013;Just what we need after a busy time at a Romanian wedding and time on the road. We were given a lovely room (422) with a large balcony overlooking the sea. Masses of space with all you would expect except a kettle. The breakfasts were wonderful - everything you could possible think of and more - champagne & strawberries - and served until 12 noon! Our classic car was safely stored in the underground car park but disgraced himself by letting out bad smells and setting off the pollution alarm.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Luxury stay on Slovenian cost;5;25.07.2013;Beautifully restored old Palace hotel is probably one of the most splendor on Slovenian cost. Hotel consists of 2 parts: old Palace part with a lot of patina and a new building. I stayed in the old part in a deluxe room with excellent bed and luxurious bathroom. The room was not as spacious as I expected, but it was tastefully furnished. Breakfast is served on a beautiful terrace overlooking the garden of the Palace and the experience sitting there was just perfect. The good thing is the breakfast is served until noon. The pool is nice, with whirlpool on side, not very big, but you can swim yourself quite good. Con: hotel doesn't possess its own, private beach. There is also no direct access to it. You can go to a nearby Meduza beach which is shared with other Portoroz hotels and has entrance fee. From that reason the hotel is not suitable for longer summer holiday and for beach lovers, who would like to have more privacy and luxurious feeling as a Kempinski guest also on the beach.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
5 star experience, but no direct beach access;5;22.07.2013;We spent 3 nights in the hotel mid July. We experienced great service and an excellent room, nevertheless bathroom is at the smaller end. Pool area is also nice, but relatively small - compared to the size of the hotel. The only con is the lack of direct beach access and the lack of a kempinski beach section. There is a joint beach section for all of the five star hotels, but you have to pay an extra eur 15 pp. Since the sea is not nice in portoroz, we stayed most of the time at the pool area. Breakfast is great and you can enjoy it until 12!!!;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
just what you can expect from a palace;4;17.07.2013;very classy place, nice professional staff, big rooms , nice big terrace to have your breakfast with excellent variety and high quality of foods.may be 2 bad points to mention, the pool is too small comparing to the very big number of rooms the hotel has , but you can still manage to find sunbeds, but the hotel has no beach.there were no tea/coffee maker in the room ( while in such hotels it must be part of the room amenities, some of them have nespresso machine in each room ) and when i asked for a kettle they said no for security reasons , I an still curious to know what do they mean by security reasons and explain it to me and to the thousands of hotels who are offering the tea/coffee maker in room.....;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

Not a five star at all!!;2;10.07.2013;"We had 4 rooms and it's our second visit and the last one!We travel a lot and often to kempinski around the world , and never found something like this..There it's so much to say, I'm not gonna make a story about this , I'll just put the goods and bads .GoodsConsierge and choffeour , attentive and willing to help.The Sophia restaurant , nice stuff very nice foods , too limited selectionThe breakfast personnel .Bads I call reception for Cleanning my room because they forgot and they answered me ,at 10 pm that this it's how they do it in this hotel! Her tone of voice was categoric and not at all friendly! Next time I called she answered with \now what\""... I couldn't believe it!!At the pool you can dehydrate because u cannot get a drink until u go to the lifeguard to ask him to get u a waiter for the pool bar ironically opened but without bartender , and if you are lucky he may find somebody from the restaurant willing to come.. I wasn't lucky every day so I had to go to back up solutions in the street to buy myself a bottle of water.Once I ordered a penne Bolognese at the pool bar, for my child and a upset waiter came with the penne, I asked her some parmigiano and she told me that they don't have! And it was hard enough to get the penne from the room service, I insisted that maybe room service may have some parmigiano and she looked at me even more annoyed , finally agreeing to ask them!! Pointless to say that when the little one was full we've got some parmigiano ...In the rooms they don't give water for turn down service, anyway this service doesn't always happen..I had to wake up at 7 every morning to get a bed at the pool but this it's not entirely their fault..In the first day the pool water was ice cold, I asked the pool person what happen and he told me that some mechanic part it's currently broken, I've asked him how long will that take to fix it he was just hopefully that during our staying!I was very surprised to see the restaurant above the pool , opened for lunch, dirty with the tables full of dust, not set for lunch at all, at first I've got the impression that they are closed! Ofcourse always empty !We had few lunches there, the service was good, ( maybe brcause we were the only table)but the chef it's not the best!We ordered one hamburger for the kid, they burned it out on one side and after covering that part with sauce they served it like that! I couldn't cut it ! How can the chef release a plate like that in a 5 star hotel restaurant .. I don't know!Do not do dry Cleanning , laundry.I did, and aprouved them to try to clean 3 little stains they told me they found!! I didn't even know about them wire the trousers for for second time,nor about the consequence of my approval !The trousers came back with big stains of clour on both legs, when I complained I've been humiliated by the girl in charge , in the lobby with people looking at us while she was explaining to me that it's my fault, they asked me in advance , she was holding up the trousers and speaking loud until I just couldn't listen to the circus anymore and I gave up...There are more like this but I'll stop here just for you to have an idea of what can happen in this hotel 100% full!!""";Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

Excellent hotel in average location : pros & cons;3;21.04.2013;I just stayed 3 nights at the Kempinksi Portoroz (I had to be in the area for a meeting). Let me introduce myself as a seasoned traveler who has stayed in some of the most luxurious hotels of the world. When travelling, I like to pick my hotels by using websites such as Kiwicollection, Conde Nast magazine, Travel & Leisure (see my other reviews). So I only like the best of the best. This is a very nice hotel, a former palace transformed into a modern, luxurious hotel. While it probably is the best hotel of Slovenia, I would not consider it a destination hotel in its own. Stay there when you have to be in the area. Things that I did like a lot :- The hotel is composed of an older palace building, and a new modern wing. It feels very airy and the décor is very nicely done. - the staff was very friendly and very helpful. Thanks to all of them. They are doing a great job.- the rooms are very large, modern, and tastefully decorated. - breakfast buffet was absolutely amazing (one of the best I ever witnessed in a hotel) and the buffet was open until noon every day (so you can have more of a brunch instead of breakfast)- I had dinner at the hotel twice. The food was good (not great) but the service was excellent and very charming.Things that I did not like that much (& suggestions for the owners) :- Portoroz is not really an interesting town. It has no beach, and not charm to speak off. I have to admit that nearby Piran is very nice though and worth a visit if you are in the area. - a street is running between the hotel and the waterfront (so the hotel has no waterfront location). This is of course something you should know upfront, as the hotel website makes this very clear.- the swimming pool contains salt water & the hot tube near the inside pool was not a hot tube at all as the water was almost cold. In addition, the floors near the pools (both inside and outside) are very slippery when wet, so take care and always wear slippers. - The airco in my room somehow was defective. When you want your room temperature to be lower than 20°C, you have to call the reception, who will arrange that from their desk. However, while the airco indicated a room temperature of 17°C, it was still very hot.- my airport shuttle left at 2 pm. I asked whether I could have the room for an additional 2 hours (check-out is noon) and I was told that that was possible but at an extra charge. That was a first to me as I never encountered this policy at a Four Seasons, St Regis, Banyan Tree, Raffles, Rosewood or other luxury chain. It is hotel policy apparently, but somewhat left a sour taste.Verdict : without any doubt the best hotel of Slovenia, but only bother staying there when you have to be in the area.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

We got lucky and were upgraded to one of their suites which was just stunning with a beautiful view of the sea. The breakfast was out of this world. You could eat anything you practically imagine, all in a beautiful setting. One evening we went out to dinner, but had to come back because I forgot something. As I was walking out of the hotel the receptionist says, “Don’t worry I’ve already called the restaurant and told them that you’d be late.” I never told them to call!

A Very Luxurious Stay;5;9.01.2013;"My wife and I stayed here in August and absolutely loved the Hotel. The service, location, and overall experience was really top-notch. One thing to be aware of is that the hotel is in the process of being renovated and that there are some rooms that are much, much nicer and newer than others. We had some friends that stayed on another floor (rooms were about the same price) and their room was not nearly as nice as ours. In addition, if you can get a room with a view of the water, I'd highly recommend it.The only negative thing I can say is that the room thermostat would not go below 18 degrees Celsius, which was just a little too warm for us. With a simple call to the front desk they \unlocked\"" it and it was instantly able to be turned down to a lower temperature. So if you find the climate is too hot or too cold, it may help to ask the front desk if they can adjust the thermostat settings.Overall, I'd highly recommend the hotel and Portoroz overall as a place to visit.""";Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Incredible!;5;7.01.2013;We spent a week at the Kempinski in September 2012 for our wedding! It was beyond incredible! The service was impecable and the hotel staff could not have been nicer. The hotel is absolutely beautiful -- the rooms are large and beautifully decorated (both on the modern side and the classic side of the hotel). The hotel pool is wonderful and a great place to spend the day relaxing! The crystal ball-room is stunning and looks like it belongs in a James Bond movie. The hotel is right across the street from a beautiful beach and great restaurants and night life. A short walk or a few minutes cab ride will take you to the beatiful old town of Piran.What makes this hotel so special is the outstanding service. The entire staff knows your name, what you like to eat, and even remembers how you like your coffee. All of our guests couldn't stop talking about the amazing service they recieved during their stay. You really feel like royalty! The Kemponski Portoroz is one of the most special hotels we have ever stayed in. We are frequent travelers and are comparing it against other 5 star plus hotels. The architecture is magnificent (this is a palace afterall). Each room in the hotel (from the lobby to the ballroom, to the bar, to the restaurants) are unique. They have perfectly mixed modern and classic design in a very tasteful way.The food is phenominal -- especially the gourmet breakfast included in your stay. Everyone at our wedding could not stop talking about the breakfast and how amazing it was. Hands down the best breakfast we have ever had (including Tuscany and Sonoma). You get to sit on the terrace each morning with a view of the ocean. Hard to beat!I give this hotel my highest recommendation. And...if you are thinking of holding your wedding there I would strongly recommend it! Feel free to message me with any questions about planning your wedding or next trip there. I can also recommend a phenominal photographer and event planner.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
nice hardware - forget about service;2;29.12.2012;We stayed for 2 nights at the Kempinski. Since November is very low season, especially so during mid-week, there were of course not many guests. The building is newish and we had a nice junior suite facing the sea. Unfortunately, service was dreadful. Since it was getting cold in the evening, we were surprised that the air con was only cooling. No chance to reach anyone by phone, we tried several times on different numbers. Finally, I went to the reception myself. The totally incompetent receptionnist had 'by mistake' turned off her phone and there was nobody else on duty... She told me that it was not so cold yet and that's why they had not yet changed the aircon to winter (heating) mode. Only when I insisted that for 300plus Euros per night we would not want to freeze, did she reluctantly agree to send someone from maintenance. When the guy turned up, it took him over an hour to fix the aircon. Breakfast was also absolutely sub-par both mornings of our stay. The buffet was big, but quality was very mediocre. Also, service was not friendly at all. Last but not least the valet parking was not working properly. We had to wait evey time , and not just a few minutes. This hotel claims to be the only 5 star property in Slovenia, but we have stayed at several much better hotels in that country. I will not be back to Kempinski for sure.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
The Best Hotel Yet;5;26.12.2012;"We stayed twice here in quick succession, as part of a break during a business related journey, which already provides a good clue.While checking out the first time, we were asked how we enjoyed our stay, I answered 9/10, and the receptionist asked why not 9? The lack of a thermostatic valve on the shower was the main reason, plus the battery was dead in the bathroom scales ( a very minor point). The receptionist noted these comments onto their computer system, We were both impressed by all of this. I am cynical enough to suspect that most hotels never take action on most such feedback, but got the distinct feeling that the Kempinsky were listening and would take action.The first stay was in a superior room, with sea view, in the older part of the hotel.Our second stay was in a standard room, with \park view\"" and without sea view, in the new part of the hotel. There was a more modern bathroom, with thermostatic shower valve. Next time, we will ask for a similar room.The only fault I could pick is the lack of fresh raspberries with breakfast, so my rating was 9.9/10 ( I don't like allocating a perfect 10).Breakfast is served until 12 midday, and was probably the best hotel breakfast we have experienced, in both quality and variety. Unlimited espresso and cappuccino coffee could be ordered, and real champagne was also available, and included.The swimming pool and spa area was very good, although Health and Safety might worry about some slippery surfaces, and also electric cables crossing the doorway to the outside catering area. (I am nit-picking).Probably the best feature of the experience was that all the staff appeared happy, and always polite and very helpful. Other hotels should send their new staff here for training.The location is very good, the climate and weather added to the positive experience. Our lasting impression was that this is the best hotel we have yet stayed at. We are trying to think of an excuse to return sooner rather than later.""";Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

the most outstanding hotel on slovene coast;4;19.11.2012;"The hotel is fully renovated 4 years ago and there are no cracks of time to be seen. The design is not everybody’s taste. Not mine...a very extravagant mixture of Austro Hungarian base and \want to be expensive\"" contemporary design. Too glamorous actually. The best thing is the bath, spacey and practical.Breakfasts are great; the best thing is that they are served until 12. Swimming pool and spa area not 5 stars, sauna is in stone and you can hear every voice, Italians (as usually) shout and enter the sauna in bath suits and stare at naked people. For a spa experience you would be probably better in Terme & Wellness LifeClass.Location and stuff great.Yes, I did enjoy it but also paid the price for it, and it wasn't low....""";Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Fabulous !!;5;17.11.2012;By almost all standards this is a true 5-star hotel. We spent one night in November 2012 and had a great experience there. Service is excellent, professional and thoughtful. I had left my iPod in the car and the valet driver took the initiative to bring it back to the room. Front desk staff was also very friendly and efficient. However, what makes the Kempinski Palace Hotel remarkable is how a run-down property has been turned into a modern, sleek and stylish hotel. Much has been done to keep as many features as possible from the original building and the result is sometimes stunning such as in the Sofia restaurant or in the breakfast room. A modern building has been added to the original one and although both could not be more different much attention has been given to have them combine in the best possible way. Rooms are extremely comfortable with everything that can be expected in a 5-star hotel plus a touch of originality such as the bright colored rococo armchairs. The indoor pool and the spa are excellent. We had dinner at the hotel (Sofia restaurant) and although there was not much to complain about we were a little bit disappointed. Given the excellence of the hotel and its services we would have expected something less ordinary. Wonderful breakfast with a great variety of juices, breads and pastries. Overall, Kempinski Palace Hotel offers high quality services and lives up to its 5 stars.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

Stayed for four nights and ordered room service few times. if you can try to avoid ordering the food as it is horrible!

The hotel is typical of it's type very well appointed, superb rooms, excellent buffet breakfast, free WiFi and it's in a very good location.

Business Conference;5;2.10.2012;Stayed here while attending a 2 day conference. An absolutely fantastic location. Hotel consists of a new and old building although it's difficult to tell from the inside. I had a room in the new building which was very modern, stylish, large and very well appointed. It has a very nice pool area although I didn't get to use the leisure and spa facilities which looked amazing. Over the road you'll find shops, bars and restaurants none of which were that busy even on a Thursday/Friday night but I put that down to being end of season.Several bars ara available in the hotel, breakfast was excellent as was lunch.

Kempinski = Luxury;5;30.09.2012;Our third stay at a Kempinski Hotel and (again) loved it. The “usual” comforts of a luxury hotel, very nice rooms, great view of the sea (if you book sea-view...), VERY attentive service and a very nice Spa, Sauna and pool area. The best was breakfast: an amazing selection and they serve it until 12:00 noon!Now they could have told us that the one of the restaurants had a private function and was thus closed instead of recommending (twice!) that we should have dinner there and do a better job in keeping the area around the pool drier (one guest slipped badly), but otherwise no complaints.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Great hotel, let down by unethical staff;2;26.09.2012;This is wonderful five star hotel overlooking the bay - pity the staff cannot be trusted. Room price was very reasonable - 130 euros for a double room with breakfast was good I thought. The breakfast had a good range of continental choices like cold meats, cheese and a variety of breads. For the Anglo Americans there was the usual scrambled eggs, toast, bacon and sausages. One could also have an omlette made to order - nice touch. There was also a good selection of international newspapers to choose from.The bathroom and bedroom were amazing - see attached photos.They have a valet service to park the car (car parking fees of 18 euros a night) but I was disappointed that the valet who parked my car stole the loose change I had left in the vehicle. I did not find out till I reached for the change at the toll booth only to find I had been cleaned out. I did call the hotel and complain to the manager but I doubt anthing will come of it.

Nice spot to hang your hat;4;26.09.2012;The Kempinski Palace seemed to be the nicest hotel in Portoroz. The setting is gorgeous (although not where you want to go if you are looking for sandy beaches). There were some spots where they had brought sand in, but where the land meets water, it's like a cement boardwalk that goes right into water that is often like a foot or two deep. The hotel is very conveniently located, and there is a great car rental place across the road. Driving is easy in Slovenia, and car rentals are inexpensive.The rooms were really nice, although we ended up in the newer section of the hotel, which didn't seem like it was as nice as the older section, so it might be good to ask for a room in the old part of the hotel. The breakfasts were really delicious, and the staff is very courteous. In general, the people we encountered in Slovenia seemed to generally want you to have a great stay in their country. It's a great spot to go because everything is so close! Slovenia has amazing things to see, all within a short drive. At the end of our stay, we took a 2 hour train ride to Venice and stayed there for a few nights, as well.The Spa at the hotel was pretty expensive, but there was a far less expensive one right next door, so I would suggest that one. The bed was really comfortable, the balcony was nice and spacious. Of the things we saw and did in Slovenia, I would say that the must sees are as follows:Lake BledThe caves (we went to two, which were completely different from eachother, and each was amazing!)Lipizzaner stallionsCroatian town of MotovunLjubliana;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Lovely setting, excellent hotel;5;24.09.2012;On the shores of the Adriatic, it is a beautiful hotel with excellent rooms and great service.We stayed in early June before the main season the price was very reasonable but it becomes very expensive later in the summer.The town is a small seaside resort with not much to do but there is quite a bit nearby in Piran and further afield if you are driving (don't forget to get a motorway vignette before you start driving as they watch out for tourists).;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
High quality - comfy bed!;4;23.09.2012;Stayed here 14th - 16th September 2012. Very impressive building - inside and out. On arrival my only disappointment was that we did not have a sea view, and after enquiring at reception were told that there were no spare rooms at the front.Our bedroom was in the old part of the hotel, very classic decorations. Large room, with a very large and comfy bed, pillows were very comfy too. Bathroom very nice and clean and lots of nice touches like a weighing scale (not that I used it!!!), bath took a little while to fill-up. I was a bit surprised that there was not a tea/coffee making facilities, only a complimentary small bottle of water. Nice large, soft and thick towels.Enjoyed our breakfast on the terrace - although I do like buffet breakfast, it is sometimes nice to be waited on. The breakfast room with the chandeliers and white furnishings are really beautiful.We had evening dinner with our company colleagues, the service was impeccable - hardly noticed the waiters and my wine glass never seemed to empty! Did not really like the fish soup - a piece of fish floating still with its skin intact was quite off-putting!All-in-all a lovely stay at the Palace hotel - would certainly think about returning again one day!;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Utterly delicious!;5;17.09.2012;"We stayed at the Kempinski Palace for 4 nights at the start of our honeymoon in August and had such a wonderful stay there. The staff was so amenable and friendly and nothing was too much for them. When our hire car gave up the ghost and the company responsible refused to do anything about it, it was the concierge who kept on ringing for hours to try to sort the situation out, and that was after we'd checked out. We had a deluxe room with a sea view in the old part of the hotel, which was well worth the extra. The room was huge, with a gorgeous bathroom with a jacuzzi bath and his 'n' hers sinks. The bed was longer and wider than my 6' husband! The view was sensational, so we decided to treat ourselves to breakfast on our balcony one morning, which was exquisite. Silver service and set out beautifully. They must have realised also that it was my birthday, and I returned to find Sekt on ice in our room, which was a lovely surprise. The breakfast room was very grand and the terrace where people mostly ate was just lovely. I have never had such a variety of foods for breakfast. There was truly something for every palate, and all incredibly fresh and appetising. The only thing that wasn't 5* was the guests themselves! Probably the most stuck up miserable looking guests I have ever seen, but that's probably because they were used to the 5* luxury and not impressed by all the things that wowed us mere mortals. They didn't spoil it though!It was just whaty we wanted to kick start our honeymoon; a touch of luxury married perfeclty with the elegance of days gone by.";Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

One of the best hotels I have ever stayed at!;5;4.09.2012;I just returned from an absolutely amazing week at the Kempinski Palace. I have stayed at several luxury hotels and this hotel is truly one of the best. Rooms:The rooms are large and beautiful, both the traditional side and the modern side. The rooms are very different but offer the same amenities. The bathrooms are large and beautiful. Each room has both a shower and bathtub. The modern side rooms look like the W hotel in the United States. Each room has a balcony. One thing to note is that the hotels in Portoroz don't have irons in the rooms. The Kempinski has their own service and does a great job cleaning/ironing. Pool:The pool is fabulous, it's a mix of las vegas modern and fun with Ritz Carlton luxury. Food and drinks at the pool were great and they even have pool movie nights, which seemed like a lot of fun. Nejc was great at the pool and treated all of us very well. Food: The breakfast buffet is included in the price of the room but I would have paid extra, it was so amazing. They had an omelet/egg station, the most delicious granola, cold cuts, cheese, and lots of bakery items. It was fabulous! You can sit outside on the terrace and enjoy coffee and breakfast. The dinners were fantastic as well, fresh fish, pasta, soups....all were great. Service: The service was the best I have experienced. It was at the level of the Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton, maybe better. Each staff member was courteous, helpful and made you feel special. Luca at the front desk was great. Thomas and Aleks were wonderful! They both went above and beyond to make our stay so fabulous. Internet: There is free wireless internet throughout the entire hotel. Amazing!I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Slovenia. It is the epitome of european luxury and class. I can't wait to go back!

Terrible experience at kempinski portoroz;4;26.08.2012;I stayed in this hotel for third time this year and i am absolutly terified with the situation here, in high season period. Cleanless in pool area is worse then you can imagine, sunbeds are dirty, also floor is constantly wet and dirty. Other services in this hotel are good, but the experience from the pool area ... I will never come again... No value for the money... If you want to spent a few days in this area, choose the kempinski in savudria, it is near by, and much more better than this in portoroz (except the kitchen, it is fabulous here, but you can make a trip here for dinner). Or come on jun or september, when the hotel is empty and the staff is able to do their job (btw only one person from staff is here to take care about poll area- is it enough? I'm sure it is not, mr.

My favorite hotel I've ever stayed at!;5;21.08.2012;"My husband and I stayed for a week at the Kempinski Palace at the end of July. The Kempinski Palace in Portoroz is a 5-star hotel by definition. It really is a grand, beautiful structure (an old palace) on the outside that has been completely updated with all the modern amenities. Our room was on the \Palace\"" side of the hotel and we found it to be light, bright, and spacious. The bed was extremely comfortable! My only complaint about the room would be that the shower temperature seemed to fluctuate frequently - not a big deal, though. Our room was promptly serviced everyday in a very unobstrusive way. The pool and the common areas of this hotel were top notch. However, my most favorite part about staying at this hotel had to be the breakfast every morning. The breakfast - by far - is the best hotel breakfast I've ever had. What an amazing spread of fresh pastries, fruits, juices, preserves, meats and cheeses - not to mention a made to order omelet and waffle line with breakfast meats and other specialties! You really must try the homemade cereals - I had this every day and I loved it. If the food isn't enough - the setting on the outdoor terrace is stunning!

If your air conditioning doesn't get cool enough ask and they will turn it down to 16 deg celsius. They don't have the same ac standards as united states. Lovely salt water pool with jets and my 30 min massage was also very relaxing. This resort has a very classy staff and the grounds top notch.

Like most posts already state the breakfast is superb. Kempinski Portoroz provides a perfect platform for a very relaxing, memorable holiday. To top it all off we were checked out of the hotel by Dragan who was the one to welcome us when we came for our honeymoon two years ago.

Kempinski in Portoroz has it all;5;12.08.2012;Every experience at Kempinski Palace was top notch. The bed was very comfortable with a variety of pillow options. The pool, although salt water, was great to have an indoor and outdoor option. Beware, the hot tub is not hot, according to American standards. Breakfast on the terrace is one of the finest we have ever experienced. The honey, dripping from the honeycomb, is a special touch. If you are planning to rent a car, work with Sixt rental agency. They partner with Kempinski, so you can drop off after hours with the concierge at no additional charge. Water is provided in the room, but not always daily. We didn't love the town of Portoroz (not as resort feeling as expected, crowded, and somewhat dirty) we did LOVE the country of Slovenia and Kempinski.

A Truly Five Star Hotel;5;12.08.2012;We have just spent a week at this hotel to celebrate our anniversary and were extremely impressed with every aspect of this beautiful hotel. We were upgraded on arrival to a deluxe seaview room which was spacious, modern and beautiful. The public areas, the pool and the breakfast were all truly first class, Staff are attentive and having stayed at many other five star hotels throughout Europe and USA, I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. We will definitely return.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
No shower cabin/curtains, strange toilet shape;3;9.08.2012;The bathroom had no shower curtains/cabin and everything got really wet. Not to mention the really strange toilet shape, which was totally uncomfortable for men. It was also impossible to raise the toilet seat.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Very nice hotel with a few downsides;4;9.08.2012;The hotel itself occupies the prime location in Portoroz, which it proudly deserves with its fantastic turn of the century architecture. The renovation just kept the facade. Inside it's completely new. The hotel appears to have the Kempinski standard, clean, modern and efficient. The rooms are spacious, well appointed, with a superb air-conditioning (effective and quiet) and great sleep quality. The service is good. The view from the sea side rooms is great. The breakfast buffet is huge and offers plenty of choices for whatever you fancy.The downsides are the pool area and restaurants. The pool (salt water) is a bit small, but worse the capacity is just insufficient. In high season it's extremely difficult to find a place. And the food in the restaurants is just mediocre and expensive. You get your stomach filled, but it's not a meal that you would enjoy if you are a somewhat demanding diner. In other seaside locations both wouldn't be that big an issue. But here it is, as first there is no real beach that one staying at a Kempinski would like to go to. They have tied up with a '5-star' beach club on the seaside, but this is an extra EUR 20 per person per day, and hardly worth it. And second there are no restaurants in either Portoroz or Piran catering to the normal clientele of a rather up-market 5-star hotel like the Kempinski.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Best in Slovenia, but...;5;9.08.2012;Without doubt the only true five-star hotel in Slovenia. Elegant, beautifully redecorated with spacious rooms, with all expected amenities, every detail taken care of. The enormous cost of rebuilding the not so long ago completely devastated Austro-Hungarian luxury hotel clearly shows in marble and decor. Reception quick, friendly and efficient, valet parking faultless. Sea view is a must, preferably in the »old«building, otherwise you might be slightly disappointed. To get to their seafront you need to cross a very busy road and pass cheap-looking shops that sadly the municipality refused to tear down for a more integrated hotel complex.I have tried the Sofia a-la-carte restaurant twice, was disappointed both times. German interpretation of Mediterranean cuisine is something I am unlikely ever to comprehend. Service at both occasions was well below expected standard, could be attibuted to the specific events that filled the hall completely and demanded top coordination. Breakfast is on self-service basis, to my regret, but the buffets are perfectly stocked and the cook on duty will prepare on demand a wide variety of dishes in front of you. Otherwise, breakfast service in the beautiful central restaurant hall is fine, bringing you a cappuccino or a glass of beer in no time.What greatly shocked me during my three visits there was wine pricing. Namely, Slovenia prides to be a wine country. I have only encountered similar markups on wine in top hotels and restaurants in Turkey (understandable for culture) and Russia (understandable for mindset). To sell a bottle of wine 200 yards from the nearest vineyard at >4 times the shop price is a bloody rip-off. Nobody in his sane mind (except for the shamelessly rich or Russians) will enjoy more than a few sips, especially so as the neighboring hotels and restaurants in Portorož have a far more normal approach. The hotel director simply has his views that can not be moved.BTW, they used to have a top French patisseur in their hotel patisserie, famous for arguably the best cakes in the country, but according to my info he left.Finally and shamefully, this is the first place in Slovenia where contrary to exisiting laws you are unlikely to survive speaking Slovenian. German or English is the official rule. Actually, it did happen to me once before, in the third best restaurant in Slovenia where Italian headwaiter did not understand a single word of this seemingly unpopular language. Still, all other staff did.You will pay quite dearly for your stay. But there again, it's a Kempinski and you expect that.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Exquisite stay;5;7.08.2012;Kempinski palace is very nice. The room we stayed in was on the ocean side on floor 3 and had a small balcony. The view was amazing and the room itself was huge by European standards. Service was great and rooms were super clean The breakfast at the hotel was excellent, it had so many delicious choices.

Beautiful Country and great Hotel!;4;4.08.2012;Slovenia is one of the beautiful countries I visited. Hotel is located just at the sea side of Coratia and Slovenia. Rooms are renovated and very new. Spent 1 week there and enjoyed every moment. Bar at Lobby is great and staff as well. If you just walk outside you have loads of fast food and pizza joints. You can just walk around in the evening. Koper is also not so far. If you really walk you can otherwise taxi. I would recommend to all to visit this place and country once in lifetime.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Very nice hotel, unfriendly and cold staff;3;23.07.2012;This is my third time in Portoroz and my first time in the Kempinski palace hotel. The first impression is nice and clean. This impression ends as soon as you check in. One of the male receptionists, probably german origin, didn't greet us properly. He was sniffing and frustrated about his job. Right afterwards we went up to our room. We had a beautiful two bed superior room with sea view located in the old part. It was clean, thus much too cold interior. I don't recommend eating in the restaurants as the dishes are overpriced and the quality is a little above average. The waiters were unfriendly to and just waited until the guests went. The spa and the pool are great, the shops to. In total I recommend the hotel to those people who care about the hotel and not so about the staff. The hotel is nice but still I think there is a lot of improvement with the staff. PS: If you want to dine good for a little less then take the bus to Piran and stroll around the sea promenade. you'll find nice fish restaurants with local dishes.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Not-so-fast in Slowenia!;4;22.07.2012;Slovenia is beautiful and Portoroz and the areas that surround it are really exceptional. Looming over the main beach strip of Portoroz is the Kempinski Palace - with an old wing and a modern wing. It faces the beach and the older wing has this sensation of decadence, luxury and old wealth. I unfortunately got a room in the newer wing with its functional luxury appearance, glass and modern materials. The lifts are transparent here, so don't dig your nose while using it.My room faced the beach but unfortunately I couldn't access the balcony as I could not get the sliding door open - believe me, I tried. The room was spacious, fresh and nice. The bathroom was also a nice enough place and best of all it had a bidet. Despite the modernity, the room had a warmth to it, which I really appreciated. Since it was July, Portoroz was quite hot. So while my dinner was at the terrace of the old wing, it was humid. Food was brilliant and service was exceptional. The next day, the breakfast service too was very good. The food on offer was not that much in terms of choice, but it served the purpose. What I liked best was those little Austrian jam bottles which had pictures of paintings by Klimt and Egon Schiele - I would have collected those. Overall, this hotel is lavish and indulgent. I would have stayed longer if possible.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Fantastic hotel easily deserves 5 stars;5;6.07.2012;This was pre booked with business so I knew very little until arrival but this richly deserves its 5 stars and could mange another one!Check in was perfect and without drama, I needed 2 shirts ironing I had just bought and requested laundry service, they had an employee at my hotel room on the third floor before I even got there, what service, and the shirts immaculately ironed and returned within the hour.The room was immaculate as you would expect, everything you need and an instant fast Wi Fi connection. All the usuall bathroom treatments with a very powerful separate shower, as is traditional in Europe the bath towel was child size but there was enough of themThis hotel commands perfect views of the beach and sea, my balcony was very comfortable with a clear view but the hotels direct access to the beach and outside shops is its biggest charm , 1 minute and you there. TV channels were limited in English, I think the news was about it but I didn't go to watch TV as there is enough going on outside.Breakfast was a great occasion, plenty of choice and exceptional service. I couldnt fault the Kempinski and would definitely return, I didn't get to use the pool area but I imagined myself stretched out on a comfortable lounger, yes definitely return for pleasure .;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
A true five star hotel;5;28.06.2012;I have stayed at Palace Kempinski this spring and it is in my opinion a real five star hotel. It has everything: luxurious rooms, great spa and pool area, excellent service. The breakfast at the terrace is simply fantastic with lots of choices, from salmon to sparkling wine and you can enjoy it till 12.00. I like the design of the hotel and its location, right in the middle of Portoroz. Only the parking price (18 EUR per day) does not fit in this picture. A good choice for a high class vacation!;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Relaxation in luxury;5;26.06.2012;Excellent hotel, just what you expect of Kempinski.It consists of two buildings, an old palace with old world charm and a modern one with exclusive design, somehow both look good together.The rooms are spacious and well equiped.The location is right in town, andas soon as you walk back to the hotel through the hotel gate, you leave the buzz outside.The sun bathing area is much nicer than the beach and therefore can get busy. The outdoor pool (33m length) is even good for lap swimming. All pools and whirlpools have salt water, which takes a bit of getting used to.The choice at breakfast is just great, you get all you expect for a continental or warm American breakfast.Hotel guests are some groups but mostly individual guests from all over Europe.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

would love to go back!;5;1.06.2012;stayed for 2 nights and it was awesome. Woke up to a view of the sea and had breakfast at the terrace. The breakfast was the best I have ever had in a hotel. So much variety of the best quality cold cuts, cheese, fresh fruit and juices - antyhing you can think of having for breakfast, they probably have. Even shots of ginger juice - was great for my hungover tummy. The staff were really friendly, especially this German guy who managed the breakfast buffet, dude spoke like 8 languages.The room was amazing, the bed was comfortable (firm, but not hard), and there were speakers in the bathroom so you don't need to miss out on anything you're watching if you need to take a leak, HA!The pool area was also great, for people who would rather lounge there than on the beach, it's perfect.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

Gem of hospitality on the Slovenian Coast;5;6.01.2012;We have travelled to the Kempinski Palace for a weekend in September. The hotel is perfectly located in the center of Portoroz close to the public beach boulevard that has a wide variety of restaurants and cafe/bars. Parking which is the biggest issue in this small coastal resort is served by the hotel's own car park(note: despite the seemingly expensive price charged by the hotel the parking fee is actually in line with what you would be paying anyway but I suppose if you shell out 300EUR/night the parking fee will be last of your worries)Breakfast: simply put it immaculate and to the highest standards, definitely go out and have your breakfast on the terrace.Room: one of the best I have been to so far - spacious, soft colours and the most spacious bathroom ever!Spa area and swimingpool: modern and clean perhaps a little too short on sunbeds for the number of guests but nevertheless very stylish and classy.Overall do not hesitate to pay a little extra compared to other hotels in portoroz because it will be definitely worth it! hope to be back soon!;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

The sleep quality is superb. I cannot decide which rooms I like best - in the new part of the building or the old. All rooms are spacious, very clean, beautifully furnished and have a balcony. Just make sure you face the front side as the view is so much better. I stayed at the hotel in December (first time was in summer) and it was much quiter now. The breakfast choice was a bit more generous in high season and there was more foreign and better trained staff then.

Amazing, but overprized hotel;3;19.10.2011;This old very well renovated palace is a unique hotel with a unique service. Staff is super friendly, the whole place is just WOW. Several bars, they project movies at night in the gardens around the hotel, own travel desk, super well maintained, etc....in oder words a real 5 star hotel.My only negative input is that the fitness is way too small for such a hotel, the deck chairs around the pool quite limited. So do like all Germans (yes I insist only Germans do that), before breakfast ¨reserve¨ a chair with your towel and than come to the pool whenever you want.....This unacceptable behaviour is tolerated from the hotel. So people sometimes arrive around twelve and block these seats.Anyway this amazing hotel is in my opinion overprized for its location. Portoroz is really nothing special. The fact that you have to pay expensive parking and quite expensive drinks is not really a necessity when you already pay 300 Euros for your room. This is not Monte Carlo, Porto fino or whatever fancy resort.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

The resort of Portoroz is small but is beautifully maintained with clean beaches and lots of facilities. It was very quiet during October, but I am told it's buzzing in the high season. A walk along the sea front to the pretty nearby town of Piran is recommended where there are plenty of restaurants by the sea.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

Perfect Mix of Old & New Elegance;5;16.09.2011;"From the moment we telephoned the hotel from Australia to request information it was as a very welcome and warm reception. When we arrived at the hotel we were met by the Operations Manager, a German lady, who had studied Hospitality in Manly, Australia and was homesick for something Australian.This is a magnificent property where the old glamorous architecture have been beautifully restored and extended merging harmoniously. The hotel takes its theme from the name of the town \Portoroz\"", meaning port of roses. The 5 levels of the hotel are decorated in a different rose colour and the rooms are large and opulantly appointed.The staff are young, professional, friendly and very proactive, the word 'no' does not exist in their vocabulary. The grounds, where pool is, are expansive with views to the ocean as is the terrace where breakfast is served.

Amazing design, amazing staff and memorable experience! Excellent!;5;7.09.2011;"First when we came we were impressed by the size of the hotel, it is huge :)Then when we entered we remained without words...top design, clean, shiny and we felt like a billion euros as it is very glamorous. The best experience I had in the Spa as receptionist really showed the best interest for me to get the best treatment. After one massage I decided to get more treatments for my self and husband and we loved it! Try couples massage, therapists are very nice, gave us very good massages. There were candles, swans made from towels in the shape of heart, vine...amazing! Its worth of every single euro!

Not bad;4;30.08.2011;Nice hotel, helpful staff at the reception! So far so good! But I and my wife were kicked out from the restaurant because we did not want to eat we came to have a bottle of good wine and have chance to smoke outside (3 outside tables in the bar were reserved and we were instructed by the barman to go to the restaurant)! Even there were free tables in the restaurant we were not alowed to take one because our wish not to eat!!! So we were forced to go outside of this beautiful hotel and to spend our money somewhere else!!!;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Very good, but...;4;22.08.2011;Since this is a 5-star Kempinski property, everything else than perfect or almost perfect is not enough and should be noted. Therefore, I will try to summarize all the good but especially the bad in this review. The room: It was almost perfect, gigantic bed, bang and olufsen TV, huge bathroom with a massage tub, plenty of storage space. However, there was no minibar and therefore no glasses which we had to ask for, the housekeeping was a bit confused from time to time - turndown service was irregular, bathroom wasn't taken care of properly sometimes. We were probably upgraded as we got a sea view room, even though we didn't book one, which was great, but I think hotel should have informed us. Moreover, the room was apparently one part of a much bigger suite, which resulted in no minibar as mentioned before, a small study room, which was very nice but unnecessary as we would have definitely used a sofa and some armchairs instead, the bell in our room was connected to the bell in the other part of the suite so when someone rang the bell there, it also rang in our room and finally, the air conditioning was a bit slow sometimes and wasn't powerful enough for the big room.The Sun bed policy: We were very surprised to have not only towels but also our belongings taken away from our sun bed after coming back from a 45-minute lunch. We were told that the staff was supposed to make sun beds available after 30 minutes if nobody occupied them. That would make sense, of course. However, there is also a no-reservation policy and when we arrived at the pool area at about 10 45, almost all loungers were taken, nobody was using them and nobody did anything about it for 2 or more hours... That was a bit unexpected in such a luxurious hotel. Other than that, everything else was great. Staff was attentive and nice, the hotel is very well maintained and elegant and the breakfast was to die for. The pool area was a bit crowded but we didn't mind that much. The indoor/outdoor salt water pool was big enough, the water temperature was pleasant. I would definitely appreciate some more sunshades, though - sometimes it was pretty hard to find a sun bed with a sunshade. Unfortunately, the hotel doesn't have a private beach, you can use other public/private beaches for a fee, but sea access wasn't very good - there were either pebbles or sea weed near the entrance to the sea. We didn't get to try the restaurants because they were overpriced and there were many other options around. I would recommend restaurants in the nearby town of Piran, which is beautiful and the restaurants are very good and affordable. To sum it up, despite the minor flaws, the hotel is great and we had a wonderful holiday. We would surely come back.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
A pleasant stay;5;6.08.2011;There is not a lot to dislike in this hotel. It is almost perfect. Clean rooms, awsome breakfast buffet with several warm dishes on order, formal but friendly service and a large indoor and outdoor swimmingpool. Parking has to be paied at 18 Eur/day! The only thing I really missed in this hotel was a hook in the bathroom to hang up the bathrobe.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Beautiful hotel and grounds;5;2.08.2011;Fantastic swimming pool and spa area. Rarely had difficulty finding a sun lounger but some hotel guests reinforced teutonic stereotypes by placing towels on loungers at sunrise.Stayed in the new wing of hotel and the room easily accomodated my wife and I and young son. Breakfast was available until midday on a lovely terrace next to the garden area and the food selection was extensive and of high quality. Staff excellent with one exception - a female member of the reception staff who was surly. Would definitely return!;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Very good, but not excellent.;5;29.07.2011;The hotel is good, but only if you are not too picky. It's new, so it is actually very beautiful and without signs of wear and so on. But the staff is so so and the waiters probably don't have a suit to change if they get dirty in the line of work. They can bring you a rare wine bottle for 5000 EUR, but you don't order it because you don't want to have it served by a waiter that does not look to be very professional and has big stains on his suit. Many staff are not Slovenian but imported from ex-Yugoslavia, so they can get lower salaries. That does not give a service standard that one wealthy guest would expect from a pricy 5 star hotel. Otherwise, everything else was very nice and the food good too, so I guess, no REAL complaints after all. Just be sure to take maybe a discount package or something like that, because the hotel is good but not as good as its regular prices are. So, we'll come back, as this is actually the only real 5 star hotel in Portoroz and one of the best in Slovenia after all.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Excellent;5;28.07.2011;"I found the hotel excellent, very nice room, building, swimming pool and outstanding breakfast. Did not use the restaurant facilities though. The Slovenian coast itself is a very nice mixture of Italian and Balkan (former Yugoslavian) atmosphere. In one word: perfect holidays. 5 stars rating is an exceptional rating, but they deserve it. Small minus point: when entering or leaving the hotel (and asking them to pick up the car for example), the reception and front desk boys are a bit \staring\"" at the guests and having their own comments amongst hemselves apparently. :-)""";Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

Avoid Portoroz...;3;16.07.2011;"We've chosen the Kempinski Hotel in Portoroz based on our (outstanding) experience with another hotel from the same group (the Duke's Palace in Bruges). But after our 4 days' stay, we have to conclude that it's not upto the same 5 star level, alas.There are 2 restaurants, so they say. But that's not the case: the one restaurant (Fleur de Sel) gets its dishes from the kitchen of the other one (Sophia), located at the complete opposite side of the two buildings wide hotel. Perhaps that's the cause of the long waits between dishes: one hour between first and main plate was not an exception, unfortunately. For the complete 3 dishes half-board menu you'd easily need 3 hours, and that's not acceptable in a 5-stars hotel. On top of that we find prices for wine starting at something like 35 and easily going over 100 EUR a bottle largely exagerated in a southern, wine producing country as Slovenia.The swimming pool is a connecting indoor and outdoor one, but unfortunately has salted water in it. The room service gradually \forgets\"" about you: the first day beds were done properly and early, and we got enough towels, shampoo & shower gel for 3 persons, but the last 2 days we had to phone the roomkeeper in the afternoon to get someone for servicing, and all of a sudden we had to manage with only two sets of fresh towels. Other details like this (although important, given the applied prices) led us to conclude that this Kempinski is not really up to its advertized 5 stars, but instead is more of an average 4 star hotel.Apart from that, think twice about travelling to the Slovenian coast. Portoroz and Piran disappointed us: practically no shops nor any cozy streets to stroll through, none (Portoroz) or only a rudimentary (Piran) coast promenade, a casino on every street corner,... To summarize: everything breathes more of an former East-European atmosphere in a region where firm Western prices are applied for drinks, restaurants & shops (if any). The slogan applied must be \""Come visit us, we need (and we'll get) your money\""...""";Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
amazingly good hotel;5;24.06.2011;I visited the Kempinski Portoroz as a member of a large corporate group in June. I expected an efficient conference hotel - and indeed it was - but it also is exactly what a 5 star hotel should be all about. First of all it is an imposing, big, classy oldi building that sits on the seafront, separated by a road and a parade of shops and restaurants. the hotel has been resored with great care. The bedrooms are big, roomy modern affairs, with great beds and bathrooms. The common parts are cool - particulary the uber-trendy white bar. The grounds are 'Slovenian zen' and the pool is nice (salt water) but perhaps too small for a hotel of this size , and surrounded by sad rows of loungers. The spa is teriffic. However the best part of the hotel is the staff ,who are simply amazing - they have eyes in the back of thier heads and are superbly accomodating and attentive. If there is a drawback, I'd say it's the town of Portoroz itself...just a bit crummy and cheap. But up the road you have Piran, which is the total reverse - fantastic!;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Portoroz's best hotel, with a stunning level of service;5;13.06.2011;I've been to Portoroz and have enjoyed good times, good food and good service in many places there, but having just stayed at the Kempinski, I must say that I'm now spoiled for any other location.Their rooms are nice with lovely views of the Adriatic. You can sit outside and enjoy breakfast as you watch the town slowly come to life. The restaurants are good but hard to get into -- reserve your table as soon as you check in! -- but if they're not to your taste, Portoroz and nearby Piran offer so many great places to eat that you should be sure that you've got an unused notch on your belt.The crowning item, however, was the service. One of the front office managers, Natasha Karat, made me feel as though she were there just to look after me and whatever I needed. I so very much look forward to my next trip to Slovenia's beautiful coast.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

Great staff, everything works as it should, very stylish interior and exterior, exellent food and also for the time of our stay - exellent weather.

Super nice fitness, WIFI, pool (in&out), spa, sauna, the best beds in the world and much more included in the price. If not the best it is certainly the best bang for the buck.

Amazing secret place;5;2.12.2010;We went to Portoroz for a conference and before coming everybody expected some kind of a village. Trieste airport didn't surprise us, but when we passed the highway and got into the town I was shocked - this is one of the most beautiful places in Europe. Nature is stunning, evergreen. In November town is quiet but I guess in summer it's bubbling as any other resort. The hotel consists of two parts - Palace and modern (kind of high-tech)- located just two steps from the beach. Room was spacious and very light, nice little terrace where you have a cigarette and watch the sunset. Ah, and you have wi-fi for free evrywhere at the hotel.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Best kept Secret;5;1.12.2010;I have never been in Slovenia and honestly never though about going there. After my stay there, I am seriously considering this as a future holiday destinations.I stayed at the Kempinski for a conference and was amazed by the quality this hotel offers. Here are a few highlights:- Every service staff addressed me by name and was not just polite (likein other hotels, but warm and welcoming!)- My room had sea view (so no problem waking up with such a great view). Bathroom was huge, with separate bath and shower and plenty of amenities- Housekeeping made sure the room is always tidy.- Room Service is just wow.: Try the Beef with black Truffels!- Conference Facilities were great and service was discrete- The Slovenian national team stayed there when I was there.There is a casino right next to the hotel, but I did not manage to go.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Best Hotel with great service - perfect for meetings;5;25.11.2010;I have recently been in Portoroz due to a conference. I can recommend this hotel with outstanding service.The rooms are very spacious and I had a great room facing the sea.The meeting was exceptionally well organized and the staff was very friendly.I even had the time to enjoy the great SPA facilites.I really recommend this hotel!;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

A beauty at the Adria;5;24.11.2010;I visited the hotel in the course of a conference. Arriving in the hotel after a drive of one hour and 15 minutes through the landscape of Slovenia the staff was very warm welcoming. A lot of press was around and we felt very honored until we realized, they were not there because of us but waiting for the arrival of the national Slovenian football team:-) still nice...throughout our stay the staff of the hotel took of us with the utmost attention and care. The room was very spacious with a contemporary and luxury interior and a fabulous sea view. The conference area is located in the newer part of the hotel having a medium sized conference room and some breakout room with modern equipment. Reataurant and Bars have very goos and attentive service staff. I highly recommend the spa Area of the hotel which is a fantastic alternation to relief from the stress of the conference. All in all a great hotel, highly to recommend;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Outstanding experience;5;11.10.2010;This is an absolutely fantastic hotel, one which I would highly recommend, and I am very tempted to go back very soon. It is a very relaxing environment where nothing is too much trouble for the staff. In all honesty there wasn't much need for the staff as everything was perfect in the first place.The pool and spa area is a real indulgence of luxury, especially after walking to Piran and back, and it was a novelty to have an indoor/outdoor salt water pool - very enjoyable.The rooms are spacious and very comfortable and the bed is divine. You can even purchase the pillows from the front desk should you get too attached and want one for your own home.The hotel is well situated and you can easily amble to Piran along the coastline. We stayed here for 3 nights, all of which were exceptional.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Amazing experience!;5;3.10.2010;The hotel itself is beautiful, the atmosphere even more so. When we arrived, we could check in early (even though it was high season) and they automatically upgraded us to a room with a better view. The room was spacious and elegantly furnished, the view was fantastic - all of the promenade and sea (we were staying at a higher floor). There's an extensive room service. Breakfast was very anjoyable (high variety food, dining alfresco on a terrace) - staff very polite and welcoming. The pool was also nice, comfortable sun lounges, although it can get crowdy in the middle of the season, very good pool menu (the best chicken salad I ever had). The garden surounding the hotel could not be more gorgeous. I would and definetely will stay there again.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
One of the best hotels I have stayed in;5;22.09.2010;If you are looking for a place to relax, the Kempinski in Portoroz is the place. It has just been totally redone and it is absolutely gorgeous! It has the best service, a reasonably price spa with great treatments and really good beds. The rooms were very quiet and very large. It is just across the street from the seaside with all of its restaurants and beaches. And, about 1.8 km from Pirin. The staff went out of their way on everything from parking our car to room service. I can't say enough good things about them.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

"When \children\"" play Hotelmanager""";3;26.08.2010;First of all, the Hotel itself is beautiful! Actually one of the nicest settings I have ever been to.However there is a lack of professionality regarding how the Hotel is managed.The Management (at least the people who we saw, like the General Manager and the F&B Manager) are quite young. I actually don't mind that, but I find it quite disturbing when these people have a problem greeting their guests when they meet them within the hotel (several times). However, you can see, that there are still a lot of problems. The staff is not very well trained. We saw that a lot during breakfast. The staff at the pool is more busy watching their PC screen than looking out for their guests. This leads to a problem when you get down to the pool after 11 am, as you might have problems finding an empty sun bed. We wrote a long letter to the GM as we always believe that you can only learn if you know. So far there was no response, let's see if we get one.It is hard for me to say if I would recommend this Hotel to a friend. It is, as I said, a beautiful hotel, but so far the service is not up to the 5 Star Standard.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Great hotel;5;23.08.2010;Excellent new hotel. Competent management, well-trained staff, even concierge knows what he is doing. Free unlimited internet in rooms! Not much of a view from the room though and the balcony too small to comfortably sit there (we were in the new part of the hotel). Otherwise the rooms are fantastic, new, shiny, sparkling clean.

Honeymoon;5;2.08.2010;"The Hotel Kempinski Palace Portoroz is a wonderful place to relax and unwind. The staff are exceptionally friendly. When they found out it was our honeymoon they kept the champagne coming. They also made a cute little design on our bed. Although the hotel does not have it’s own beach, it rents a part of the best private beach for which you have to pay 20euro a day per person. We found this to be a very acceptable solution for the time being. They are nice enough to give you some fruit and water for the beach. There is also a very nice inside/outside pool area and a sauna area, both of which we enjoyed tremendously as they are very clean, calm and have a sense of peace about them. The breakfast is also spectacular by any standard. (you can literally get whatever you want...except for caviar) They organize film nights outside when the weather permits; also a very enjoyable evening event. Now for the tiny ‘flaw’. The food, although of a high quality, lack imagination and is as a result overpriced. The menu also lacks inspiration. (It fails to utilize local sea-food, truffles...ect.)";Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Nice Hotel experience, but Portoroz might be not the right spot for it;4;16.07.2010;Beginning July I spent 2 days for a business meeting. The rooms are spacious, and very relaxing. Staff is friendly, but somehow I have the feeling that the staff is not at usual Kempinski level. Soem of my colleagues arrives before midnight and had to look half an hour to find someone for checking in. Excellent Spa treatments, and very nice swimming pool. The quality of the food is excellent, but maybe 2 comments on this: the a la carte restaurants are a bit overpriced, and for this level of Hotel I do not like that at breakfast you have to pick your marmelade with a spoon out of the pot. (maybe I am spoiled, but at this level i expect nice tiny little marmelade glasses) About Portoroz, what should I say, I know the place very well, and it is not something to compare with Saint-Tropez in France. Nice shops are absent, just the usual tourist shops, so somehow the level of this hotel does not fit in the environment. Will definitely try the other Kempinski in Savudrija, just 30 minutes away from this one.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Beautifully restored ‘Grand Hotel’;5;3.07.2010;Hotel Kempinsky Palace is a beautifully restored ‘Grand Hotel’ at the boulevard of Portoroz. I would call it a design hotel that has opened its doors only last year after an extensive renovation. The hotel overlooks the sea, but there is a rather busy road in between. The crystal room is planned for breakfast and it has a fantastic terrace to enjoy the breakfast buffet, that has an overwhelming choice of food and freshly baked eggs. The lunch was also very good.The room was large, with a design bath room and all toiletteries you expect in a 5-star hotel. I had a large balcony. Free wireless internet. Worthwhile to mention: excellent sleeping quality of the bed. There is a parking garage below the hotel, which I never saw as the door man parked my car, which was very convenient of course.All staff was extremely friendly and helpful, with attention to small details. Really a great service. I enjoyed my stay from the beginning to the very last moment.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Best hotel in Slovenia;5;1.07.2010;This is probably the best hotel in whole Slovenia. Exellent service and everything what you demand from 5 star hotel. Beach is on the other side of the road. It is a bit overcrowded but hotel has a private part with sunbeds und umbrellas. If you prefer you can stay at quiet and nice hotel indoor and outdoor pool. Good SPA superb breakfast. plenty of restaurants with good seafood in the neibourhood. Close to major Slovenian attractions - caves, Piran, Bled, Lipica, Ljubljana, Koper.

Design is dominant in this sleepy Seaside ressort;5;1.06.2010;Travellers -this is a fantastic hotel with lots of interesting design elements - i waas personally really surprised to find stuff in decor and rooms that vi had not seen before. The Hotel is placed in Portoroz, which is good for a few days but certtainly offers many cheaper alternatives to stay. However, a super'nice country like Slovenia really deserves a Hotel at its short coast like this Kempinski quality place.Of special note is - Restaurant Flor de Sal- The Spa place, with an outdoor swimmingpool- the small but stylish Gym withz brandnew equipment hardly ever used- the Cristal room for the breakfasti can recommend a sty for a few days, and make sure you go by PIRAN for dinner one night.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325

Beautifull Hotel with Pest problem;3;18.02.2010;We stayed in the hotel in spring 2009 with our daughter. The hotel is beautiful and the rooms comfortable and there is nothing bad we can say about the location and the food. Never the less we have had a chance to see cocroaches in the childrens playroom near the main lobby and after mentioning it to the staff at the reception we received an answer that somebody forgot to close the door leading to a storage or something. The second negative comment is that the hotel has by far to small gym for its category and it is located in the top floor very poorly marked (at least at the time of our stay). By the way, despite the fact that I smoke, the manager of the hotel left a negative impression by smoking in the bar alongside the restaurant. Bravo, it does seam that laws are not made for everybody.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
classy and amazing- the best place to stay in Portoroz;5;4.01.2010;"One of the best hotels i`ve ever been to. Beautiful historical building that reminds past centuries, amazing environment, great staff...rooms were, as i`d expected, stylish like in other hotels of this cathegory (grey`n`light brown tones) with a huge bathroom and all the necessary accessories (slippers included;-). Even though we didn`t have a room with sea view (it overlooked the garden), i was pretty surprised with lavender pillows and the atmosphere in general. The only thing i remembered as negative was the overpampering of the guests:-). Staff kept knocking on the door asking if everithing was ok or if we need something etc. The stricker \do not disturb\"" would do the trick;-)Check out the breakfast. (the best choice ever!!! try the granola cookies and youghurts.)They even had the healing teas and cranberry juice which came in handy by the time i was there.

Lovely building, not so the service in many areas and the location;3;29.12.2009;A Kempinski hotel in Slovenia - a new hotel in a country we had not visited before. I ignored a review I had read about Portoroz prior to booking - it had said that every country had a Blackpool or a Las Vegas and Portoroz was the Las Vegas of Slovenia - in a way the review was correct. The Kempinski hotel looks magnificent sitting there in its well manicured gardens. However it is surrounded by hotels and buildings that are neither elegant, well cared for or even remotely attractive. Directly across the road from the Kempinski are shops (not worth a look), casinos and bars which play very loud music until 4.00 am every morning. So loud infact that having your windows open was impossible. We had driven from the UK. In a 5 star hotel one expects a porter to immediately spring into action as soon as you drive up. Not so here. Not impressive. Check-in staff good.We had a suite facing the sea in the old palace building. I say facing the sea as a seaview would be an incorrect description. The sea can be glimpsed to left and right but the buildings across the road obscure much of the seaview. The suite was lovely. The bedroom was rather cosy, but the big bed was comfortable. The 'pillow menu' was a plus although when we requested feather pillows they took an age to arrive. The sitting room was huge with a dining area at one end. Flat screen TVs in bedroom and sitting room. However, when we wanted to listen to music via the tv we would have been charged a hefty fee - not on!Good bathroom with lots of good quality products to use. However, the temperature on the shower would vary for no reason and we escaped scalding on several occasions. We reported this and were told they knew about it but there was nothing they could do.Housekeeping was dreadful. Every day something was wrong. Some days they simply forgot to service the room. Towels and products were not replaced. Empty wine bottles and trays of coffee not removed even when the room had been serviced. On the first day we requested extra large dressing gowns - they arrived just before we went out for dinner - when we returned they had vanished with the 'turndown staff' we assumed. It took another day for others to arrive - not good. Some days the bed was turned down - others not - ditto fresh towels being supplied after pre dinner shower. Housekeeping staff were too few, badly trained and badly managed.Never ask room service for a tray of coffee. Always took more than half an hour - coffee was always cold - one day they forgot the milk the next they forgot the biscuits - we gave up.The buffet breakfast was good, heaps of choice, hot, cold, everything you could possibly want. The fruit and fresh ginger shots were a real wake-up!! However some days the service was dreadful. No-one seemed to be in charge and no-one was specifically charged to show you to a cleared table and ensure there was cutlery and staff to attend the table. Some days you could wait ages for coffee. Too few staff and those that were there were often badly trained and had no idea how to serve at table. Staff with attitude first thing in the morning is a definite NO.We feel the hotel needs to rethink its dining facilities. The Sophia Restaurant - very formal - too formal really for a hotel in a resort like Portoroz. We went once. The food was good but the service unacceptably slow. No-one on hand to give good advice on wines - we know a great deal abount Italian and French wines but not Slovenian - if they want to sell some they should be able to advise accordingly. The room itself is rather gloomy and depressing. The hotel needs to rethink how it communicates a dress code to guests. Shorts and tee shirts are not really acceptable for dinner in a formal restaurant! The other dining option is the Fleur de Sel. Far less formal with some outside seating.However the menu needs to change far more frequently. No difference in Lunch and Dinner menu. If the hotel wants people to eat in its restaurants it needs to have a drastic rethink. Having dinner there one night, we ordered a bottle of Italian wine - it took over half an hour to appear and was very cold. We were then told all wine was 'kept at the other end of the building' - hence the long wait. We would regularly meet other guests in restaurants in Portoroz and Piran who felt the hotel was missing a trick. Most of the restaurants in Portoroz and Piran have very similar menus, my husband thinks there is one communal kitchen!!!The so-called pool-side bar was a joke. Some days what appeared to be students sometimes appeared to see if guests required drinks or a snack. Service was very slow and unprofessional. The snacks menu lacked everything, content, imagination etc. You are relaxing by the wonderful pool on a sunny day. You do not want to have to move, get dressed to go outside the hotel for a snack...........come on Kempinski get your act together. There was one table with chairs by the pool. The others were low coffee tables with chairs, no shade, no umbellas.The pool area, inside and out is lovely. Big terrace, lots of comfy sun beds etc. Great facilities also in that area, turkish and steam rooms and ample supplies of good quality towels.The Spa too was extremely good and the staff excellent. Good choice of treatments - I had a hot stones massage and facial which were amazing. Beware the manicure and hairdressers room. I did not know that this was not actually part of the Spa - nowhere was this made clear although it is of course in the hotel. When I came to the end of the worst manicure I have ever experienced, (my nails have not recovered yet), I asked for the slip to sign for it to be included on our room bill as you would expect. It was only then that I was told they were not part of the hotel spa and could I pay now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!A problem occured on our departure. We left our bags in the middle of the hallway in our suite - all in one place. We asked a porter to collect them and take them to our car. As we had driven from the uk we had several bags and were travelliing onward to Tuscany. We went to pay the bill and then drove off. When we arrived in Tuscany later that day we were one bag short. I telephoned the hotel, told them where the bags had been left, they sent someone up to our room and sure enough - the bag was still sitting there. They sent a driver with the bag to our destination in Tuscany and it arrived before midnight the same day!Lovely building, hopeless housekeeping and sloppy service in many areas. Its no excuse for a 5 star hotel to not be firing on all cylinders from the moment it opens its doors to guests. Excuses are not acceptable. If local staff cannot maintain a standard of service required for that level of hotel after professional training - its a serious management problem.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Mixed feelings;3;29.09.2009;We stayed in August one week with our two little children. As mentioned the hotel is very nicely renovated, has lovely rooms, a great terasse to enjoy the wonderful breakfast buffet, a nice garden, many motivated and friendly employees and great food at room-service. Still, during our trip not everything was perfect: Four times electricity went down in our room, at the ckeck-in desk the employees had to answer the phone at the same time as making the check-in, luggage arrived an hour after ckeck-in, room service for cleaning sometimes came, sometimes not, once at 10 pm (not helpful with little children) and forgot half the things to do... As we wanted to go a day on the beach, we had to pay an extra 40€ per adult, just be be on a stone wall strech between many other people, in the same squeeze as at the pool (which is nice..). At night, no one wanted to turn down the volume of the outdoor movies. I phoned many times, at the end no one answered at concierge or reception desk....After I complained, we received a bottle of sparkling wine and later from the GM a invitation to come back, so mangement acted quickly and in a professional way. I have to say that other guests we talked to did not encounter the same problems we had. For us and with this prices, unfortunately Kempinski standards where not met this time and I guess that more training is needed to give the employees more self-confidence and natural joy for their work. We went a day to the Kempinski in Istrien which has a big and lovely pool area for children. Potoroz is quite crowded in August, but not the loveliest sea side village yet (I have been reading a comparison to the Cote d'Azur - this is really exaggerated!), which is a bit of a contrast to the lovely Kempinski Portoroz. The sea was also nicer on the Istrien than Slovenien side.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Nice interier, but they SHOULD really work on staff attitude;4;13.09.2009;"We spent one night only for my conference reason, but my wife tried it as a holidaymaker. Problem started allready when I tried to reach the reservation service by telephone - the line was constantly broken. We made it via mail, but anyway at the end they wrote my company name wrong on the bill...ehhh.The building is indeed renovated on the site of the historical Palace hotel. So you can see a mixture of styles - some of them like that, some of them not. The direction signs from the main avenue are definitelly to small (note for small blue plates). Place is indeed shiny allover and our room was big enough with a big balcony and two sun beds(superior room, sea wiew). The technical equipment of room was good and the decoration tastly chosen. For 250 EUR/night we got a single bottle of still water in room as a reception gift - allright, lets say fair enough. When we arrived, nobody gave a helping hand with luggage, the boy actually stared away through the window. The check-in procedure was pretty fast, basic informations on the reception were adequate. At the evening they helped us with the \emergency\"" toothbrush set, but needed ca. 30 minutes to deliver it. At the breakfast we waited much too long to be asked and served with a coffee. Girls (obviously international staff in training) seemed confused and actually did not speak really good any language. When wrong person sitted at the reserved table (it was just near mine), they used a sentence \""this for somebody else, please go\"" !!!!! Definitelly much to low attitude for a 5 star Kempinski. Otherwise the food selection is rich and breakfast takes untill midday. The indoor swimming pool was nice and clean and they have finnish, turkish and infrared sauna. You can also get a turkish massage (Hammam). The pool and saunas were totally empty on saturday morning, which was nice. At the end the check-out was slow and they obviously had not connection with booking service, I needed to tell them again all billing information (other guests waiting behind me in a row - like in a supermarket). Reception staff payed more attention to chit-chat among them than to a guest sitting in front. Finally again nobody offered a help with luggage transfer to car. I might did not look as a local mafia boss to be treated reasonably. And yes, they forget to charge garage fee (18 EUR). I was bad and did not remind them ;-).

...;3;28.07.2009;Yes, this hotel is the best you can get in this town. But unfortunately we were not so satisfied with this hotel. Paid more than 1k/night for suite, we didn´t get what we paid for: 1. balcony of Lagune suite is not a private balcony, is connected with other suites and also with the public fitness center (you cannot feel privacy while enjoying the jacuzzi) 2. fruit in our room after arrival was mouldy and we didn´t get another fruit troughout our stay, 3. housekeeping service was not appropriate and not on time, 4. Lagune suite and public fitness is connected only with the door, so we were not able to sleep, when someone started to uplift the dumbells early in the morning5. terrace wasn´t cleaned throughout our whole stay in the hotel, it was full of bird feathers and bird excrements,6. final bill was 10% higher when compared with the real comsumption, more than 250 € is a realy big mistake, than corrected without any apology... and many other problems, but the building is realy beautiful.

From as far as I can judge and have heard from others, this is by far the only true 5-star hotel in Portoroz. The hotel itself is a great mix of classic, timeless charm and contemporary design. The food was great (I had 2 lunches there). Very nice spa (I had a super massage) and swimming pool. The only reason I give 4 points to location is because the hotel is not directly on the beach - but that's apparently the case of all hotels in Portoroz. Regarding value, the hotel rates are logically on the higher side if you compare to its neighbors - but again, there is no comparison possible.Net, a great place to spend a charming long weekend.;Kempinski Palace Portoroz;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeKempinskiPalacePortoroz;Obala 45, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5147033;13.5919325
Adequate value for the money paid;4;4.05.2017;Selecting rooms and the whole package quite early and staying in the hotel outside of the main season was perhaps the reason of a very favorable price for the spacious room and half-board.The room with sea view was really large, balcony was a plus. Bathroom clean, with all required amenities, large enough.The hotel tried to prepare seasonal (Easter) dishes which more or less success: the food (perhaps with the exception of ice cream) was very good, considering it was a buffet style.;Remisens Premium Hotel Metropol;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeRemisensPremiumHotelMetropol;Obala 75A, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5103374;13.5954584
Beautiful 5-star hotel that justifies value for money;5;23.03.2017;"The entire hotel is beautiful and has the overall atmosphere of the 5-star hotel. The rooms and bathrooms are clean and comfortable. The queen size bed is super comfortable, especially for one person :-)The breakfast is just fantastic in its richness and variety. The staff are guest-friendly and helpful. The list of cocktails at the lobby bar is rich and I could recommend mojito :-) The swimming pool area is pleasant and very comfortable.On a bit minus/cons side: It is not fully clear why the hotel that has its own parking has to charge 10 Euros per day;Also, the practice of prepayment (20 Euros) and then full reimbursement (20 Euros) for the towels one needs for the swimming pool is not clear either - if this type of the hotel is in question";Remisens Premium Hotel Metropol;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeRemisensPremiumHotelMetropol;Obala 75A, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5103374;13.5954584
expected more for 5 star rating;3;22.03.2017;This hotel have seen better times although my feeling is that everything in subordinated to the hotel casino. When booking the website stated free parking but in reservation confirmation (and also in reality) the parking is payable what I found out when arriving to the hotel and asking where to leave my car.On the other side the breakfast is a feast and everybody can find something for their taste, everything is fresh and in huge quantities.Room and the bathroom are small - balcony is bigger than the bathroom - but clean and table size is a little bigger as your laptop so working is a little chalenge.;Remisens Premium Hotel Metropol;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeRemisensPremiumHotelMetropol;Obala 75A, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5103374;13.5954584
Expected more, this hotel is lacking given it star rating;3;15.10.2016;Upon arrival at the hotel, we drove our car up to the entrance and no one was there. We went to reception and the person behind the desk did not greet us until he finished sorting his papers. The initial impression was not great and this was not the end of it. The main lobby looked dated - as if once it was a grand hotel, but its time had passed. There seemed to be only a skeleton staff in place. The room itself was ok - great views of the sea for sure...the best part of the hotel in fact. The room itself was old and the bathroom more of a 3 start than 4. The dining is all buffet style. It is a huge dining area and really gives a feel this is big cafeteria for the masses. Overall, it was at best an average stay. We thought we got a good price, but in the end I felt we maybe overpaid for what it was.;Remisens Premium Hotel Metropol;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeRemisensPremiumHotelMetropol;Obala 75A, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5103374;13.5954584
Too old and too bad service for a 5 star;2;22.09.2016;Very old, over-dated with untrained staff and extremely slow restaurant service. Old and dirty lobby toilets, dirty carpets in the restaurant. We used the service of this hotel while accommodated in the annexed brand new Premium Roza Hotel that can be recommended for its new look and good equipment. The Metropol hotel itself can not be recommended from our point of view - neither as a 5 star nor as a 4 star property.;Remisens Premium Hotel Metropol;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeRemisensPremiumHotelMetropol;Obala 75A, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5103374;13.5954584
Mixed stay;3;22.07.2016;This hotel sits above the resort town of Portoroz. It is attached to the casino which made it very popular and gave it a busy feel. As a result the front desk was chaotic on arrival but it turned out we only timed it badly as at other times it was quiet. Staff were informative and courteous. There is a busy drop off point at the front of the hotel but it is big enough to handle half a dozen cars. The car parking is handled by a valet and was charged separately to the room. Room 404 was a good sized room with practical furnishings and bench space. It had a good sized bed with pillow menu and there was plenty of storage space. One of the highlights was the large, private balcony with a stunning view over the water. There was a welcome chocolate on arrival which was a nice touch. As for facilities there were limited TV options most being in Italian. There was free wifi. which was easy to use and had a good signal. Air conditioning was feeble even when on the highest setting and it could not handle mid 20's afternoon heat. No coffee facility in the room but bathroom amenities were very well stocked and fully replenished Excellent internal soundproofing complimented by the layout of the hotel meant that we never heard any noise from adjoining rooms or the corridor. However the external soundproofing was average. This was highlighted on our second night when we had to put in a noise complaint to reception. From 7.00pm to 9.20pm there was loud music being played from somewhere in the hotel and it was so loud that even with the windows closed we could still clearly hear it. The woman at reception had an extremely unprofessional attitude about it, explaining that other guests were responsible for the noise as they were having a Salsa Party and she thought it was all a bit of a laugh. Breakfast is a massive buffet in a very large restaurant, but things get cold quickly. Whilst there was plenty on offer it took them over 15 minutes after opening to finish bringing all the food out. The coffee was average. Overall the hotel was probably how we expected it to be but for the price it was a reasonable stay.;Remisens Premium Hotel Metropol;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeRemisensPremiumHotelMetropol;Obala 75A, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5103374;13.5954584
A Shocking Experience;1;7.07.2016;"I go to Portorož every year. An extended weekend. This time I decided to go for Grand Hotel Metropol, thinking that checking into a five-star hotel would be a guarantee for a hassle-free holiday.A disaster. The air-con didn't work. I asked for another room and they said they were fully booked. On the second day at 7 pm there were 29 centigrade in my room and I asked for a fan. Since after an hour there was no trace of it I went to the reception, where they explained that the maid is busy elsewhere and she would be with me asap. Went back to my room, packed everything and left. Beforehand I explained that it wasn't the lack of aircon, which made me leave, but arrogant and self-absorbed attitude of the staff. It was only when I was leaving that the receptionist offered another room. When I confronted him with their reply from a previous day, namely that they couldn't do anything, they were booked, he said: \Well, that's what my boss said!\"" OMG!!!I refused to pay for the accommodation and contacted the booking portal to make an official complaint.I find it \""hilarious\"" that a five-star hotel in the mid of peak holiday season can not find assistance to come and fix the air-con on a Sat or Sun. Horrible!The hotel, otherwise has very little to offer. Buffet bkfst is below average for a 5* hotel. I also had a massage in their wellness. I was massaged by a student, who' doing a summmer intern. No experience at all. Paid full price though.The hotel is run down. The shower was full of cracks, the drainage was rusty. Upon entering into the room I found a 10-cm long hair on the toilet cover. I moved the chair at the desk, it was full of dust.The only nice thing was the view of the sea from my room. But little did I see of it. had to keep curtains closed all the time to prevent heat coming in.Major disappointment. I'd like to underline the fact that one can take a lot, except the arrogance of their staff.""";Remisens Premium Hotel Metropol;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeRemisensPremiumHotelMetropol;Obala 75A, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5103374;13.5954584
generally good, but a bit outdated;4;2.07.2016;The hotel is clean and comfortable but has a bit outdated outfit and also interior. Our room was large and well furnished, we had a partly sea view with a view to marina Portorož. It was quite noisy out in Poortorož, it usually is during the summer weekends with music from the beach bars until midnight. Dining staff were all good, just a bit disorganised. We had half board and the food was good, for breakfast and dinner.What we didn't like was joined dining room, with the sister hotels' guests sitting on one side with one buffet, and the Metropol's guests on the other. For breakfast, the sun terrace was a lovely place to sit. The sea-pool is good although it had just started to operate when we were there in the middle of June. A few complaints:the sea-pool bar/cafe was badly run. We saw lots of people give up waiting both to order and pay. . Afterwards, tables weren't cleared, no follow up drinks orders and you to chase around to pay and last, but not least, should a 5* star hotel charge for using the gym.;Remisens Premium Hotel Metropol;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeRemisensPremiumHotelMetropol;Obala 75A, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5103374;13.5954584
Terrible service;3;1.06.2016;Me and my family have been visiting Metropol for almost 10 years two/three times a year. Since Remisens took over the leadership, the hotel level and quality rapidly dropped. Restaurant service was terrible. Once we've finished our meal, they left our leftovers and plates on the table until we left. Moreover, when we arrived to the restaurant, nobody even noticed - we were not even able to order a cup of tea. They all look as if we were bothering them. Talking about the fitness, I don't think it's appropriate to charge hotel guests of 5* hotel for an entry fee (in addition, we are talking about an extra small fitness centre with a few machines). One more thing that bothered me is the fact you have to pay a deposit (20 Euro) for towels when you want to go to the swimming pool area. Talking about pools and pool surroundings, there was a lot of mess from trees and bird droppings all around. It definitely didn't feel very convenient. I had to wear shoes every time I wanted to move from my sun-bed. Overall, I think the worst thing about this hotel is the service, waiters and crew. One does simply feel like he's bothering them. However, hotel rooms were clean, perfect and spacious.;Remisens Premium Hotel Metropol;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeRemisensPremiumHotelMetropol;Obala 75A, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5103374;13.5954584

Food is terrible;2;17.05.2016;The room was Ok and the hotel looked nice but the down side of staying here is the pool and the food that is terrible. The food used to be good here a few years ago but it has really gone down the toilet. Nothing at dinner stood out as quality and breakfast was also a yawner. Looks like the chef is not eating his own food. The pool is old and dated and the hot tubs were not hot at all. $20 towel deposit for a $5 towel and 16 euros a day for parking were a nice touch. NOT !! The TV in the room has NOTHING for children and very little selection for 2016. Looked like a TV from 1970.

So average is hurts how much you payed;2;24.02.2014;"This hotel does not deserve five stars at all. Major minus staff behaviour and food - we stayed in february,empty hotel, no smile and warm welcome. We were given key cards that were overused and the receptionist didnt even consider them being unsuitable, when we brought them back to the reception table. We booked half pension (self service) but were not even advised until dinner time that there will be no self service and that we are supposed to choose from menu that litterally said (calamari, grilled fish, turkey breast,bolied potato,rice and french fries,ice cream,pastry). The pastry was \we dont know,let yourself be surprised\"". Which five star hotel serves diner food?! Since we were on a road trip from Opatija, I would recommend 4star hotel there with half pension anytime over these five stars! Since there was nothing we could change, we enjoyed at least the sea water pool - the lifeguard was the first person to smile in this facility!

Breakfast was plentiful, lots to choose from (toaster took an age to work though and it pretty much gave up by the end of our week!) and with good times to eat (ie did not finish too early!).By staying at this hotel, you save a lot going to the pool directly opposite as they charge entry fee, sunbed hire, umbrella hire and towel rental. All of these are free of charge when staying at the Metropol, you just show your room card upon entry.I think the only downside to this hotel is that I feel it needed a little redecorating.

A second time in Portoroz;3;15.06.2013;This was my second consecutive stay at Hotrel Metropol Portoroz and my impressions are more or less the same as last year. The rooms are comfortable and spacious, also quite clean. Possibly the furnishing is not to everybody's liking, but one should leave a bit of individuality to hotel owners. Just imagine how boring it would be to have hotels with franchized furrnishing. As for the food, I agree with other reviewers that half pension is probably not such a good idea because the dinner is really nothing special. On the other hand, breakfast is great. They cater for Italians who are satisfied with a coffee and a bun and for northern/western European guests who consider breakfast their main meal of the day.Friendly staff, non very visible but present.The casino is not really a problem if you have other interests.;Remisens Premium Hotel Metropol;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeRemisensPremiumHotelMetropol;Obala 75A, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5103374;13.5954584
Wonderful hotel, attractive location and good quality/price ratio;5;31.10.2010;I stayed in this hotel few days in mid October 2010 (staying in large double room with extremelly large king size bed). The hotel has been renewed almost completely (all rooms, lobby, restaurants partially, piano bar, while outside seems less renewed). Rooms are very beautiful, spacious, ellegant with high comfort standards. All hotel services & staff are very professional and kind meeting all our requests with smile and efficiency. The view from large number of hotel rooms is wonderful due to hotel's location, next to Portoroz marina. Breakfast is European continental, very good in terms of offer and quality with kind and pleasant staff. There is pool and jacuzzi with sea water - they are nice and clean but not such excellent for 5 stars hotel standards. Wi-fi connection is free and available in whole hotel. Parking is on payment (approx. 9 EUR/day) but at least hotel staff is 00-24 available to bring you the car from garage to the entrance in few minutes from Your call. There is bus station bellow the hotel (it takes 2 min to reach it) - every 15 min there are buses for Koper (Capodistria) and Piran (Pirano) at convinient price (1 EUR).Highly reccomended hotel in terms of quality, location & price for such a comfort if You prefer to visit Portoroz i.e. Sloveniean seaside.;Remisens Premium Hotel Metropol;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeRemisensPremiumHotelMetropol;Obala 75A, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5103374;13.5954584
nice weekend;4;12.01.2010;We spent weekend in Grand hotel Metropol in July 2007, which was only 2 month before borning of our dauther.

Lovely area - Horrible food.. and you might want to stay away from the pool..;2;6.06.2008;This is, as others has described, not a five start hotel. The rooms are big, the balconys OK, but the standard is more like a three star.It would be OK, if it was not for some major problems:1. The food is horrible. Reeminded me of the cooking at summer camp when I was a kid. Dinner buffet with over cooked meat.. Breakfast consist of dry bread, and slices of meat that are being left out in the warm room for hours. 2. The pool. Well - it was nice when we were there. But when we got home, we had a nasty surprice - stomach-flue. We were a large group that stayed at this hotel, and only the ones that swam in the pool fell ill. It might not be the pool, but I doubt it. Our doctor says the bacteria that coused the illness was a typical thing to get from a pool like this.It is salt water, and very warm. When we were there, it held 30 C..So if you are going to this place, use the lovely beach in stead.I also recommend the wonderful cities of Piran, Koper and Isola in stead of Portoroz. Much nicer, and better food....;Remisens Premium Hotel Metropol;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeRemisensPremiumHotelMetropol;Obala 75A, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5103374;13.5954584
good for gamblers !!!!;2;16.01.2008;stayed here in august last year with my husband and two sons aged 11 and 16. Although Portaroz its self is a very nice resort i would not reccomend this hotel for families . The main reason being is that the hotelis mainy geared towards gamblers due to its large casino. There was no evening entertainment for the children and the food was disgraceful. There are many nice restaurants in Piran which we took a taxi to nearly every night, even though we'd booked half board with the hotel, In the hotel describtion it mentioed that it had tennis courts and other sport facilities but was in a different location to the hotel and at a extra cost. While my son was playing mini golf he got his toe caught inbetween the cracks of the rocks and broke his toe for the rest of the holiday. His toe is now de formed from the shocking pavements! mini golf not reccomended to play in flip flops.!;Remisens Premium Hotel Metropol;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeRemisensPremiumHotelMetropol;Obala 75A, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5103374;13.5954584
Not so grand Metropole;2;7.01.2008;July 2007. Was booked as a 5* hotel. Certainly is not and only someone who is an inexperienced traveller would consider this hotel 5*. Some parts are of a good standard. Swimming pools and spa of a high standard. Room a bit dated and lighting in the bathroom very low. Room had a good sized balcony and a reasonable water view. Bar had no Gin, so no G&T or cocktails but their loss was that we went to the waterfront bars for entertainment each evening. The very worst aspect is the food! Diners from the two sister hotels come to eat in the restaurant each evening. It is all buffet and a cross between school diners and a motor way cafe. There is not dress code and shorts etc. worn all day (in some cases several days) are acceptable. There are few separate tables and diners have to share long tables with strangers. Food is cleared onto trolleys at the side and left in full view. The food itself is hamburgers, sausages, stews, chips etc. deserts are yoghourt, fruit, fresh and tinned and bought cake. the guests who are staying at the Metropole can select from several reserve dishes, for example mussels which have sat out for up to two hours! These dishes were then served up for everyone the next day.When we complained to the rep we were told we could pay more to dine in the a la carte restaurant! Not worth it - more of the same, but with a waiter!As the holiday company wrote to us '5* is a matter of opinion. ' My opinion is DO NOT stay here!;Remisens Premium Hotel Metropol;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeRemisensPremiumHotelMetropol;Obala 75A, Portoroz 6320, Slovenia;45.5103374;13.5954584

Friendly, caring, always smiling and ready to give you advice about trips in the surroundings, what to do, where to go,... Food was tasty, self service meals, drinks in the bar not expensive.

I would say 90% occupancy by bikers.The first, 50 people were having gun on the terrace, drinking (not getting drunk) and making jokes; a light party I would say.Without any prior notice, at around 1:30AM the front officer called the police and 4 security vans came with around 25 cops (SWAT type of cops) and were using verbal violence and intimidation to send us to sleep. They have been told that people on the terrace are not hotel guest!!!Eventually we managed to talk to the cops and let them talk that's a lie but what a welcoming we've had!!!That's unacceptable!

But at the check out I was overcharge by 50% (they charge me full price instead of a packet). I didn't notice it immediately , so I phoned them few days later. I got verbal apology and a promise to be refunded. Nothing happened until I send them e-mail, so the whole process took over 2 weeks. I still can't believe it!!!

Very poor appartements;2;28.08.2014;We stayed on the appartements on July 2014. After spending a week in Lake Garda, Italy in good hotel we moved over to Slovenia this hotel/appartement resort.At first look hotel looked very good. The reception area is clean and looks rather new. That is just the hotel side though. The appartements are located on the hillside and those are very worn and dirty. We spent first night on the smaller first floor room without A/C and that was the worst night in years. There was no way to cool down the room and it was really warm in the room.After the first night we moved to bigger appartment and that was better. It had an A/C but even having it on coldest setting it could just keep the temperature in decent numbers. The room looked like straight from 70's. Nothing has been renovated. The hotel garden area is big and rather ok. However it was very full of people and the swimming pool was with salt water that was not nice surprise for our kids. In our company we had 4 kids 6-11 years and they did not like swim in that pool. And the pool was closed very early (18:00). There is fence around the pool so it is really closed. Breakfast was not included into appartement price and we tried it couple times. It was very average compared to other breakfasts we had during our summmer trip in Italy and Austria in same price group hotels.Hotel location is very quiet and there is basically nothing to do without car.

could be better;4;13.08.2014;We just returned from our stay in Salinera apartments and I am quite satisfied with our stay.

Since we have a dog we could not stayed at the hotel but in the apartments which is ok. It is clean and affordable, no mosquito nets but...It takes you 146 stairs to get to the beach and 59 to the restaurant. The beach is not the best, but its clean, the sea is clean and there is a saltwater swimming pool which is nice. The nature, the air, the silence in the night is priceless. But! The staff...and I only mean the two older guys who simply do not care about guests, who are rude to the point that you are afraid to ask them anything. They are not Slovenian, and also they do not speak any foreign language. They speak bad things about the guests in they own language, which I understand, they were very rude with the group of people with special needs who were guests all in all shameful for a 4 star hotel.

Great setting, underwhelming apartments;3;25.09.2013;I have mixed feelings about this place - the apartment prices are affordable but the accommodation standard was not very pleasing. The apartments have a worn look and feel.The bed was comfortable albeit squeaky and the wardrobes were new. The bathroom needs renovating, there was no A/C in the apartment (apparently some have it and some don't so make sure you request the one that has it if staying in July/August), the TV was old and unwatchable.The buffet breakfast was excellent, plenty to choose from (although it was disappointing the puddings were some cheap German brand instead of Vindija...). The buffet dinner was alright, it would have been nice to have a seafood dish also (fried hake is just wrong).The restaurant staff was 'interesting' to put it nicely. Some of them were not very skilled or didn't seem to care much. On the first evening, the majority guests thus looked unsatisfied. I was appaled that they'd actually employ people without foreign language skills. It was ridiculous to see they had to go and fetch someone else for a German speaking customer (I wonder how they handled the group of German pensioners that came the next evening). Not sure how their English skills are, let's just say I was happy I'm a native Slovenian speaker. :)The indoor swimming pool was nice, had a pleasant swim each morning before breakfast. However, there is no shower gel provided so bring your own. I also really missed a gym. The location of the hotel is great for a walk in Strunjan and it's a short drive to anywhere along the Slovenian coast really. The secluded setting is brilliant, the swimming stretch of the hotel 'beach' is quite clean, the 12 energy points park is a great idea (provided one knows what to do with it) and the outdoor swimming pool looked pleasant (it's closed from mid-September on).Overall, a great setting and affordable - but could use renovations and restaurant staff training.;Salinera Bioenergy Resort;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeSalineraBioenergyResort;Strunjan 14, Strunjan 6323, Slovenia;45.5248871;13.5990707
Good for the money;4;11.09.2013;Me and my husband stayed for two nights in the bungalow Nr. 719, payed 160 EUR for a halfboard. We made the reservation through Booking.com and it was a two star bungalow. It wasn't as basic as we expected, it had TV, air condition, was spacious and clean. The bathroom was big enough, but needed to be renovated, so was the front door and the door to the balcony. The kitchen was big enough, well equipped. It would be nice to have something to dry the wet swimwear and towels on, other bungalows had it. We had breakfast and dinner in the hotel, which has 4 stars, but the food wasn't 4 star, it was 3. Plenty to choose, but not fresh enough. It was nice to have free drinks.The sea is a five minutes walk and there is also a swimming pool near the beach and it was very clean. If you want to have a nice, quiet, peaceful and not expensive vacation, it is the right place!

Great wellness experience;4;19.07.2013;I only visited the wellness part of the hotel, but I was really pleasantly surprised. Nice, clean, no annoying muzak in the massage room, and the massage was a bliss!!! I can only recommend tui-na, maybe it won't suit everyone as it's a very strong massage, but I loved it. Extremely relaxing! And the best part is that you can relax on a beach afterwards!The only minus point was that the shower didn't have a shower gel in it, but I just used the handwash then. Friendly people, too. I had booked my massage through the general call centre of the whole Bernardin Group and they were super friendly. Because the wellness centre wasn't open yet, they did the booking for me and then sent me the confirmation by e-mail. Wow!

We had an 6 persons appartment. It was very spacisous with nice balcony with view to outdoor pool and hotel garden. The appartment was clean and equipped with modern and elegant furniture. It consists of large living room with folding sofa combined with kitchen and dinning area. The bedroom a bit smaller but still large. The kitchen was equipped with all modern appliances- dishwasher, induction cooker etc. The appartment was fully airconditioned.The hotel garden is beatiful with some history and calls you for relaxing. The outdoor pool is close to sea, it is quite large and clean. It was already open in the first week of June. The sea was a bit colder but still nice for swimming. The sea access is from the small mole or there is very small pebble beach.The nature around is beautiful. They work on renew of Strunjan Saline park close to the Hotel Salinera. There is a great walk to the Strunjan cross and Strunjan cliffs, where you can go down from cliffs to sea.

Good in the essentials;4;22.05.2017;In all the most important points this hotel has a very good standard. Our room was comfortable and very clean. There was a rather small bathroom but it had ample storage space for toiletries even if those provided were somewhat basic. There was a very well designed balcony, private and with a pleasant view. The food also was a pleasant surprise as I have had much inferior food in more expensive hotels. The main courses for dinner were all full of flavour and the vegetables and salads were cooked in interesting ways with unusual ingredients. Pasta also was freshly prepared and the deserts did not have the usual 'industrial' taste.One or two minor complaints. First we had confirmed a reservation for a room with two beds when in fact there was only one. Two bedded rooms, we were told, were only available without balconies and in our case we preferred to have the balcony but for some this could be a problem. Secondly I found it odd that we were asked to pay extra for the saunas. When I questioned this I was told it was to keep it clear for people who come in for the day. Well I am not a hotelier but I would have thought the first essential was to provide good facilities for your guests - but there again what do I know. I found the pool area dark and because of the currents and salt water rather hard to swim in and water in the outside pool was cold.In the most important points, however, food and room, I found the hotel of a high standard and would visit again.Prices for the wellness centre and prices of drinks were all acceptable, which is not always the case. Service was adequate though at times a little slow and, though polite, not particularly friendly.;Svoboda Hotel;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeSvobodaHotel;Strunjan 148, Strunjan 6323, Slovenia;45.532464;13.6027313
In reality this is a 3 star hotel for the price of 5;3;3.05.2017;"Way too expensive for the service they are offering. Average room, disappointing dinner, extra charge for sauna, but great pool and jacuzzi. Friendly staff and nice nature. But there is only one restaurant and pool for hotel guests and also for guests from health centre, who wear tracksuits and Crocs slippers at dinner. So, if you pay list price like I did, you feel a little disappointed. If your stay will be paid by health insurance then it is great. Otherwise you pay the price of 5 star hotel for almost \hospital\"" experience.""";Svoboda Hotel;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeSvobodaHotel;Strunjan 148, Strunjan 6323, Slovenia;45.532464;13.6027313

We were received with incredible hospitality- upon arrival we were offered welcome drinks, got a tour of the hotel and the staff helped us carry luggage; restaurant staff was very friendly and even the chef got out to greet us. If we were late for dinner, we would get a call to double check whether we can make it with reasonable delay so that the kitchen would stay open a bit longer to serve us; hotel staff even remembered my name after the first day and they were taking care of every detail and small request we had with care. The hotel itself is very clean, the food buffet is healthy and rich.

Fantastic place;5;23.08.2014;I get used to stay in 5 star hotels, but this one is definitely not worse and even better despite of the range of 4 stars.

Room is spacious, food is superb( you will not have Turkish variety but the taste and quality is amazing ). I liked spa very much (the quality and price), but you need to book 2 days in advance , as they are rather busy.They have very good guest relations which organize Nordic walking in the morning every day, excursions to the nearest towns on the bus and on the board.

A comfortable choice in a quiet area;4;21.07.2014;We had a very nice 5-nights stay in the hotel. We liked especially the indoor and outdoor swimming pools where we could enjoy sea water even in colder weather (plus our 1,5 year old child didn't like the sea much anyway so this was a great alternative). Our rooms were great-the hotel gave us a suite which we didn't have to pay extra for becausr they thought it could be better for us-and it was great-the child sleeping in one room, the parents enjoying the evening in the other. The suite is opposite the lifts, though, which made the rooms quite loud in the evenings. We loved the location of the hotel-very quiet and safe. In comparison to the touristy Portoroz we were happy that we made this choice. The only thing we didn't like so much were the meals. There were queues, you had to choose quickly, otherwise you blocked the others and the whole system had a bit of a socialist-times taste for us. Our toddler was quite distracted by the environment and we couldn't let him run around just like that-there was no play area and the place is huge. If you are looking for an alternative with a toddler, we recommend tbe restaurant Primorka in the area, they have excellent meals and a play area inside and outside, too.;Svoboda Hotel;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeSvobodaHotel;Strunjan 148, Strunjan 6323, Slovenia;45.532464;13.6027313

Nice hotel, especially for children with respiratory problems + they have a free charge point for EV;4;9.01.2014;We visit this hotel quite often, especially during the winter time to get out of the smog of the city and for our daughter to swim in pools of warm sea water. The hotel is surrounded by a beautiful scenery, sea and trees, clean air, which also makes it a perfect place for nice long walks on the beach and cliffs.Wi-fi is not top speed, but it's good enough. It's not meant to watch YouTube video streams, but it's good enough to browse web pages.Staff is friendly, food is very good and there are plenty of menus available also with fish and sea food.What I also value greatly is that they have a free of charge Charge Point for Electric Vehicle which we have (Opel Ampera (=Chevy Volt)). It saves us quite a bit of money.I also like, that they have a playing room for children, which my daughter loves (3 years old).I don't know about the AC, because we've never been there during summer, but what I don't like is that the hotel turns off room heating radiators during the night. If it's cold outside, less than 0°C, it can get quite cold in the room, even when fully covered by a blanket. That's why we always bring a small 2000W portable electric heater with us.I also don't like the type of pillow they have. They are to high (big) so I don't use them at all. Even though it's not comfortable to sleep without it, it's still better then what they have.Because of these two issues I gave 4 stars review and 3 stars for sleeping quality.The room TVs - I don't know who chose them, but they are horrible to switch channels. It takes a long press on the remote the even change the channel or type a number of a channel and even if you do it correctly, the TV set takes about 2 second to change the channel. They are Philips TV sets, which are good TVs, as we have one at home, so I don't know, what's wrong with the hotel ones.;Svoboda Hotel;Slovenija;Seaside;SlovenijaMorjeSvobodaHotel;Strunjan 148, Strunjan 6323, Slovenia;45.532464;13.6027313
Room 135 distaster full of insect;2;15.08.2013;When I reach hotel I have been given a room 135 as I am travelling alone. First impression was quiet good. I even got a terrace. I was happy because of a hard work before I will enjoy the see, swimming and other things I would do. Entering the room I notice a strange blood on the wall. As someone would try to kill an insect. At that moment I didn`t mind at all. When I went to bathroom I meet a large insect moving on the wall. I fill a little strong pain in my chest. I have claustrophobia on insect. I kill it and continuing as nothing happpened. After dinner I came back to my room and put myself on band. I Watch TV. Suddenly something fly over my head. It was a large butterfly not that nice but insect. I froze for a moment. Then I turn around my head and notice some insect moving on the wall.I couldn’t kill them. They were high for me. I got panic and pain in my chest start again. I decided to pack my thing and go down to lobby to ask a receptionist to give me another room so that I can stay there. He said that there is no bad free for me. I beg him just for one night but not a chance. So the only things I could do was leaving hotel after 7 hour of stay. He asks me to pay 115 eurov for being there for 7 hour and dinner and that entire scary insect. In the room 135. I have paid. I leave reception very said, and with pain in my chest. I already have problem with breathing. But I have to drive a car to reach home. I try not to think but over and over again “I so that scary insect”. When I reach home I was totally down. They gave me tranquillizer so that I could breath normally.. So when you travel to this hotel alone avoid ROOM 135 itis full of insect.

Stylish boutique hotel with amazing restaurant. ;5;10.07.2016;This small family run hotel sits at the edge of Kranjska Gora with a beautiful view of the Julian Alps. A new beautifully designed building using lots of wood and natural materials, it has only 10 bedrooms. Our room on the 1st floor was spacious and well equipped with a large en-suite wet room. The walk in rain shower was great to cool down under, after a day walking in the mountains. It was worth upgrading to have a balcony but there is a small terrace with seating outside with the same view. There was often background music playing on the terrace, which I enjoyed but one guest did complain that she found it intrusive. There is no air conditioning, which given the 33 deg heat on our last day, would have been welcome. The local bus stop is just outside and the busses start quite early but the glass sliding doors were well insulated and we weren't conscious of the noise at night. I never travel anywhere with out earplugs anyway being a very light sleeper. And now the food. Breakfast was one of the best spreads I have had anywhere. Fresh home made bread, cereals, meats and cheese, fruit, cakes and eggs cooked to order. As for the meals in the restaurant at night, it was like eating in a Michelin starred restaurant every night. The presentation was exquisite. They catered for my husbands dietary requirements without blinking, even providing a selection of desserts, other than sorbet, often a no go area for the lactose intolerant. The staff were excellent. If you are looking for plates piled high with food the restaurant is not for you but if you enjoy nouvelle cuisine, we haven't eaten better in a holiday hotel restaurant.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871

"An amazing place for all the \foodies\""!""";5;18.03.2017;We were a party of 11 and when we saw SKIPASS hotel is participating “spring restaurant week” we just had to visit them. An amazing gentleman, Mr. Adem who took so very well after us, provided useful and very tasty food suggestions who all turned up to his high recommendations. The 4 course was very good and especially the main (quite big sea brim) was an absolute winner. Whatever he would suggest it turned out to be more than amazing! My suggestion – just follow his advice. The restaurant has a younger dedicated chef who will soon become one of Slovenia’s finest. His individual and original approach becomes more than mouthwatering and makes you hungry for more. All the ingredients were local and worked extremely well with the suggested wine. My suggestions – if you are anywhere close to Kranjska Gora, make sure to pay them a visit and let yourself in the good care of their staff!;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871

I had a late night check in arranged and on arrival I was met with a plated meal in my room and a complimentary drink which was very welcome.Rooms are modern and very warm, comfy bed, good hot shower facilities which is most needed after a days skiing. Food is excellent and a mix of traditional versus modern with a choice of two dishes for half board evening meals and a large selection for breakfast. Drinks are reasonably priced. If you are a single traveller the supplement to have a balcony is 30 Euros per day which is rather excessive. The stay also included one visit to their sauna which I had exclusive access to. You could visit again but at a charge of 30 Euros per visit which again is rather excessive. Shame as many hotels offer access inclusive to guests.The hotel is just on the outer edge of the village but is a very short and beautiful walk whichever route you take to the main ski area. So it's away from everywhere and one of the most quiet locations in Kranska Gora.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
Amazing - an absolute treasure!;5;9.02.2017;This hotel was recommended by the staff at the Hotel Cuba in Ljubljana. We live in Keystone, Colorado and we love the mountains, skiing and mountain town atmosphere. Hotel Skipass did not disappoint! This is a new, modern and chic hotel with the feel of an old ski town. The family that owns the hotel was savvy, fun and great hosts. The rooms are really nice and new. We stayed in the top level suite and it was perfect for our family of four including two teens. Here's how great this hotel is...we planned to stay one night and ended up staying for three nights! The hotel is walking distance to everything - including the mountain. The restaurant is exceptional and the family hosts special dinners with wine at a reasonable price - no reason to ever leave. The outdoor patio is breathtaking...with views of the highest peaks surrounding the village. Breakfast was made to order and delicious. The staff was exceptional. They gave us passes for our kids to swim at a nearby hotel (weather was 95 degrees) and always went out of their way to talk to us. The owner even drove us to the train station in Austria. We LOVE this hotel and promised to return in the winter so we can ski. Kranjska Gora is a tiny ski town and was exactly what we were looking for as we explored Slovenia.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871

The best Christmas ever!;5;3.01.2017;My wife and I have just returned from a week's holiday in Kranjska Gora, Slovenia, staying at the beautiful Skipass Hotel.From the moment we arrived late on Christmas Eve, we were made to feel welcome and nothing was ever too much trouble for the wonderful staff.Our room was very comfortable and offered amazing views of the mountains and the communal areas of the hotel are clean, modern and tastefully decorated.As if that wasn't enough, the food was on another level altogether and it came as no surprise to find that the Skipass is also one of the most highly rated restaurants in Kranjska Gora.We will certainly be returning to the Skipass Hotel in the future!;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871

Nice saturday in Kranjska gora;4;24.10.2016;"The purpose of visit was pleasure and Hotel Skipass can give that! The room was big, modern equipped with large bathroom. There was some problem with room temperature, but later during the night they solved the problem. TV was big screen, what is not so ordinary in four star hotel, but the variety of programs available was were limited. We had also dinner, which was the main reason of visit. Restaurant decor is nice, dinner was really something special, because we ordered special menu from \restaurant Week\"" offer. For their chef I can say the he is really man with a lot of courage and some elements of dinner were big surprise also for me. Specially powder of pumpkin. Generally was was not so good for my taste was sweet taste in almost all dishes. I took the meat menu. The service could bee better, specially when you offer wine pairing with selected menu, then the waiter should know what wines are in that pairing. All the food was described correctly.

Superb Boutique Hotel;5;28.08.2016;We spent two weeks half board in August 2016 at The Skipass and loved everything about this superb hotel. It is spotlessly clean. The staff are unfailingly helpful.

The dessert was my favourite dish and I think every tourist in Kranjska Gora should try this! The chefs are really great!

Fine Dining at Faulty Towers??!!...in whose opinion?!;2;21.08.2016;A small, but not friendly, family-run hotel who need to address several issues before they earn the title of “Fawlty Towers” due to the offensive and arrogant manager.On the second day of our 10 night stay whilst sitting having afternoon complimentary coffee and cake outside the hotel, admiring the view of the bus station with the backdrop of the mountains, the manager curtly asked me to move to the other side of the table so he could accommodate his “honoured” and more important guests, who I believe were from a local club.I was explaining that I had chosen this seat in order to avoid the direct sun, and his abrupt and rude response was that it will “make no difference”. At this point, I did not realise he was the actual hotel manager as he was dressed in T-shirt and shorts. I did move to the other side of the table out of courtesy.On several evenings, he appeared to be entertaining and catering for other large groups, effectively displacing his hotel guests from the facilities and relative comfort. Unfortunately, the numerous smokers amongst them contaminated the air well into the evening, making it very unpleasant if you wanted to sit on your balcony, notwithstanding the large volume of noise from his “honoured” guests.There was a noticeable absence of any greeting or pleasantries from the manager throughout our stay and we rarely saw him communicate with the other guests. His pleasant wife would smile and talk to the guests however.The dining area for the common guests (note that the manager previously referred to as budget-hotel clientele!) parallels the modern bar, tables two by two style, and only the a-la-Carte and the manager’s “honoured” guests have the privilege of dining in the small, but pleasant dining area., situated through glass doors at the end of the bar. Interestingly, we and the other hotel guests were displaced here one evening due to a? family and friends gathering requiring a long table. It would have been polite and appropriate to be asked and previously informed about the event as several guests arrived for dinner wondering where they could eat and have some calm away from the large volume of noise created by the “honoured” guests.I have never, and don’t expect to feel like a second class citizen in any hotel and this is a feeling you may experience too.If you lead a sedentary, holiday life-style, the calorific value of the evening meal may be just about sufficient! If however, you were walking at least 10mls /day on average, you would find the well-presented, pretentious food served insufficient, lacking balance and is mostly devoid of vegetable and sufficient carbohydrates needed for an energetic lifestyle! As a keen skier, I would avoid this hotel as the so called “fine-dining” is inappropriate for most people after a long day on the pistes! Also, there is a long walk to the ski lifts if you are carrying your skis. The amuse-bouche (1 mouthful), is followed by a starter (3-4), then the main course (5-10mouthfuls if you are lucky). Whilst the waiter/waitresses are pleasant and helpful, their translation of the menu choices into English is often lost and inaccurate, so don’t be surprised if you end up with pork having ordered veal. It would be so easy for the manager to organise a written menu to avoid this problem.The family have a tendency to rapidly defend and throw back any minor issue or request raised (e.g. breakfast 15mins earlier than the usual 8:00am) rather than go out of their way to be helpful. Some of the other staff were far more understanding. They need to learn how to acquiesce and be far more flexible for their guests.This is a truly honest and accurate account of our stay in Hotel Skipass…certainly worth skiing past in my opinion too!;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871

OK ... but overpriced;3;18.08.2016;On the positive side:- Modern facilities with good taste.- Very nice and welcoming staff.- Free parking and Wi-fi.- LocationOn the negative side:- The public spaces / facilities of the hotel are very limited.- No recreation facilities (only sauna at a high extra fee)... thus not really a 4* hotel.- Since the town itself is very limited, guest get confined to a room with basic (although nice) and limited furniture ...As such the hotel is strangely overpriced, namely in comparison with more popular sites nearby (like Bled).

SKI PASS(T) THIS HOTEL??;2;11.07.2016;"Well that would be my response if I was planning to book this place.There are some good points about the hotel though.ROOMSThere are only 10 rooms,some having a balcony,others just a roof(velux type) window. There is no air conditioning in any of the bedrooms,which is strange in a recently built hotel,and no fans were available either. The roof rooms with sloping ceilings are extremely hot and stuffy.Beds are comfortable,but they only have doubles in the balcony rooms,and linen was changed once in our 10 night stay.Surprisingly there are no tissues in the room either,or tea/coffee making facilities.Space is adequate,with a settee in the balcony rooms,and the bathroom had a nice walk in shower.The fridge is a waste of space,as it cant keep things cold,and is 75% full of the mini-bar items.They tell you the room safe code,which you cant change????? so not much security there,as the codes are never changed!!!The hotel is very clean,and modern,and quite often our room was serviced whilst we were at breakfast.The view from our room 104 was stunning,if you ignored the bus \station\"" immediately in front of the hotel lawn.WALKING.Kranjska Gora is in an ideal location for walking,many of the circular walks start in the village,and using the Cicerone Guide \""Walking in the Julian Alps\"" is a great aide,as routes are clearly explained.A visit to the Tourist Information enables you to buy for 5 euros, a reasonable map with numbered walk routes marked on it.Newly erected signposts everywhere on the walks make getting lost quite difficult.An efficient bus service operates,enabling walks from many other starting points,a timetable being obtainable from TI.HOTELThe outside front of the hotel has a narrow area of decking with tables and chairs in a row, there is a lawn,but it has \""Keep off the grass signs\""! There is no area at the side or rear of the hotel to relax in,away from the bus station,and what would be a tranquil view of the surrounding countryside.Piped music continually plays outside,and there are no comfortable relaxing chairs available(not that you would want to sunbathe in view of the bus station anyway!)Inside the hotel a large,and somewhat unnecessary reception desk is to the right,with hard reception seating opposite.There is nowhere else to sit,or any lounge area.To the left of the entrance is a long bar,and what remains of that area is a \""dining\"" area, which could be described as corridor like,with large windows. A glass partitioned part at the far end is reserved for A la Carte diners,which is not what most guests have booked on a Thomsons Lake and Mountains package. The first two of the dining area tables are situated within 1 metre from the hotel entrance! (charming!) FOOD This is the most disappointing part of the whole report,apart from the Manager(later). My brother and I (retired GP and Banker) are used to the finer things in life,and thus selected this more expensive hotel purposely,expecting first class treatment,and an equivalent standard and choice of menu.We had TWO choices of starter,and TWO choices of main meal,and NO choice of sweet!!This was compounded,unfortunately,by the inability of staff to adequately describe the choices in English,so one had to guess somewhat and hope for the best.Of my 10 meals,I enjoyed only one.The quality of the food on most nights was not in question,but the quantities can only be described as meagre,and totally inadequate for a normal diet,let alone after a 10 mile walk. There were no vegetables,no soup course,no salad bar,no coffee with the meal,unlike other local hotels.It was just pretty,played with food,and on one occasion I could have ate all the main dish in four mouthfuls,though to be fair it was normally six to eight mouthfuls!Our \""choice\"" of starter one night was pea soup, or barley soup;another night one of the two starter choices was fish,and that applied to the main course as well ( So it was Hobson's Choice if you didn't like fish!)Whilst checking in to the hotel,we were told that breakfast was at 8am,but if we wanted it earlier,just to ask the night before,so as we were being picked up to go to the airport at 8.35 we asked for an earlier breakfast by 15 minutes. The owner/manager came over to our corridor table(and this was the first time he had spoken to us, apart from telling my brother off for not wanting to move to another table outside so he could accommodate his valued locals) to say NO we could not have breakfast 15 minutes earlier. We objected to this,and felt his response was threateningly aggressive,and basically he said we should have stayed somewhere else if we could not accept hotel RULES ! I reminded him that in England,when customer satisfaction is sought, \""the customer is always right\"". We had observed on several occasions during our stay,and talking to other guests who felt the same,that he paid much more attention to his locals and friends.His attire when attending guests at dinner,( tee-shirt and shorts ) was also inappropriate.Would I return? NO.Could I recommend? NO. Did I loose weight? YES!!PS No doubt he will respond to this,but dear reader,judge his retort as an indication of his attitude towards guests.I have only stated facts.""";Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871

smart hotel, pity about the food;3;13.06.2016;This is a new ,clean comfortable hotel in a very beautiful small town. We had visited Kranska Gora previously five years ago and stayed in a budget hotel. This time we upgraded to what appeared to be the best hotel. There we were no problems at all, except with the food. When we arrived the hotel was almost full and the food was fine e.g John Dory for the evening meal. However after three days there were only six guests altogether and then things changed. The food was still beautifully presented a la nouvea cuisine but the quality was very poor. The choice for evening meal is not quite take or leave it, you have a choice of two meals.This evening the choice was venison or pasta. As we aren't keen on venison we chose pasta.It consisted of pasta, tomato sauce basil and of course parmesan cheese.No mushroom, no protein ,no vegetable. When we complained we were told we should have chosen venison.Enough said.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871

It was very spacious with a beautiful bathroom, amazing rain shower.The buffet breakfast and a la carte dining were both exceptional. The cellar offerings were amazing and included the orange wines unique to Slovenia. We also had a mocktail of juniper foam and blueberries which was awesome.On our second night we had the degustation menu which was a tribute to the food of the nearby Italian border - a modernised play on very traditional ingredients. The owner personally acted as our sommelier and was an exceptional host.For my taste, the room was slightly too warm; and like most Slovenian hotels, there was no in-room tea and coffee, but these were minor inconveniences.

Most enjoyable.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
Excellent hotel, Excellent food.;5;30.05.2016;A very modern and clean hotel just a short walk from the town and slopes. Rooms are a good size with a large bed, plenty storage and a spacious wet room. The views of the mountains and slopes from the balcony are breathtaking, everything about the hotel is of a really high standard and the food in the restaurant is no exception, possibly the best food we have tasted in ten seasons of skiing. The restaurant staff were very friendly and helpful making sure every night our dining experience was one to remember.Less than a ten minute walk to the slopes/town you'll find everything you need, ski hire, supermarkets, bars and restaurants even spar hotels with swimming pools. There is a free bus service from outside the SkiPass hotel that will take you to the slopes each morning, although times are a bit sketchy and the walk through the town is easy. I would certainly recommend the use of the storage facilities offered by the ski hire shops for about €30 p/w.Kranjska Gora is a great ski resort for everyone especially learner to intermediate skiers, plenty nursery slopes and a few challenging runs for the more experienced skier. The lifts are all quite new and very efficient and the pistes are well managed.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
Ski holiday;3;24.05.2016;It was a lovely hotel but for our 3 night ski holiday I was disappointed. When we arrived at 1pm in the afternoon keen to ski we were told the ski hire shop was closed and it was too late to ski! I then walked with 2 children to the slopes and sorted out our own ski passes and equipment hire - we then skied the afternoon and night skiing too!! The hotel was very busy with BMW staff and on our final morning the restaurant was full with a queue of people waiting to buy ski passes stood a yard away from us eating our breakfast!!The staff were all very friendly, especially the lovely lady who was brilliant at making hot chocolate, but in terms of a short break for skiing I think we would have been better staying in a bigger hotel closer to the slopes;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
Excellent hotel ;4;20.05.2016;This is a very modern hotel. We stayed in the spring. Boutique skipass was the ideal base for hiking in the Julian Alps. The owners were extremely friendly & welcoming. Breakfast was excellent. Plenty of free parking, & an easy walk to the village centre.

New fresh Scandi style hotel;5;19.04.2016;Lovely little family run hotel in the pretty town of Kransjka Gora. Beautifully designed rooms, large, comfortable with nice views.Restaurant and bar area can feel a bit soulless with quite bright lights and although there is a fireplace in the entrance, sadly this was not lit during our stay.Food was delicious every evening and staff friendly and attentive.Great location for access to several resorts nearby, we skied in Slovenia, Austria and Italy. You'll need a car. Kranjska Gora perfect for beginners or small children.Would definitely recommend this hotel.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
such kindness inspires;5;18.03.2016;Unfortunately I have not had a chance to spend the night or eat in a restaurant, but I have to praise the kindness and helpfulness of the staff in the two situations.First case: We bought special tickets for skiing at ski pass for travel agencies at a gas station in Jesenice (Petrol). A friend had mistakenly got a ticket for the wrong date. How not checked the date we have come to the ski resort and could not ski with this ski pass, and had to buy a new ski pass.On the ski slopes, we pause from skiing called hotel ski pass and explained to them the situation, and we agreed that after skiing I come to the hotel and that friend compensate for the ski pass. When we arrived at the hotel we ordered coffee and explained as we come. Nice girl and waiter returned money to a friend and told to. He is a ski pass at the price paid 31 eur, but they are a regular back price paid by the ski resort 43.50 eur, and so has seen after a loss of 12.50 eur, and friends are fully financially compensate.After we had coffee we wanted to pay and say goodbye, but we were not allowed to pay for coffee and once again our apologies for the inconvenience.A large and deep slope for courtesy and professionalism. I recommend this hotel and the agency for tourism each.And on another occasion when we just went and bought an action ski pass hotel manager kindly explained (with a lot of patience) the best and quickest route to the ski resort.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
Perfect;5;2.03.2016;Great experience in Hotel & Restaurant Skipass in Kranjska gora! Staff was kind and professional, food was delicious, room was bright and clean.

Hotel where you feel like home.;5;2.03.2016;The location is superb, right next to the ski resort. The room was exactly as pictured. The staff were all so friendly which made my stay feel even better. And one of the best was delicious food. Lughter is brightest where food is best.

Elegant, boutique hotel but warm for families;5;20.02.2016;For a family friendly ski holiday with a touch of elegance and decadence, I heartily recommend Hotel Skipass. We stayed last week with our 5 and 7 year old. The owners and staff couldn't do enough to accommodate our every need. It was a particularly wet week and they arranged for staff to come out to open up their ski hire shop near the slope specifically so that we could dry out our gear there every evening - despite us having mistakenly hired it elsewhere. (We wished we had asked the hotel about their full ski package...). The food!! Imaginative and delicious. There is a full a la carte menu available but we were on a half-board deal which kept the final bill lower. Even so there was a meat and a fish option of both starter and main on the every night. Incredible sea food broth & trout sashimi were personal faves . Our fussy kids ate their body weights in homemade fresh pasta and bolognese. But the highlight every night was the dessert. Inspired and very, very skilfully crafted. Some of the most delicious food I have ever eaten. I read the previous review about a BMW event. This was also on over both weekends of our stay, but despite making the hotel a little busier on Saturdays it didn't hamper the service offered to us one joy. Thank you and well done Hotel Skipass.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
Ski Holiday 2016 (2nd visit);2;7.02.2016;Just got back from another fab week skiing in Kranjska Gora and stayed at the Hotel Skipass for the second year on the run, The resort was just as good as last year and the slopes well groomed and as efficient as always.We skied every slope and enjoyed every minute of it (The Podkoren is my favourite and its even better when you get a private lesson from one of the Austrian team coaches who was in the resort with his team practicing before they fly to japan next week for the world championhips).Now for the downside of the holiday.Trip advisor always asks for honesty in its reviews and thats what i will be.We arrived at the hotel at 10.30pm due to an almost 3 hour delay to our flight and were greeted by Ana who was very welcoming as this was our second visit and she remembered us from last year, we had room 106 which was really nice with great view of the slopes, as we missed dinner we were provided with some cold meats and cheese and bread in our room which was nice.last year the food was amazing and we were really looking forward to this years evening meals, but all i can say is that it didn't live up to last years food.The Deer was nice on Sunday night and the Pasta and Monday night was lovely but the rest of the week it appeared that the chef was cooking and serving food that they thought people wanted but to be honest after a long day on the slopes you want some hearty food not fussy food that looks good but doesn't really deliver, and as a lover of deserts i found the different offerings of foams and sauces lacking in both taste and that little bit of sugar indulgence we sometimes crave basically the deserts were not deserts but tasteless plates of nothingness. The hotel offers a la carte but in the week we stayed i only saw 2 tables booked for a la carte in the evening which says a lot about the food and the price.It was BMW preparation week in the Hotel whilst we were on holiday and i am afraid to say that all the owners were interested in was the corporate BMW people who were due to come to the hotel for what looked like a freebee spin in a car and a free glass of wine and BMW pen , it was clear that they took priority over the Hotel guests and considering we paid good money to be a guest it wasn't value for money on that front the hotel advertise a multitude of trips to other resorts but when we tried to book a day in Monte Lussari (a fantastic ski resort in Italy 30 minutes drive away) we were told that we could maybe go Monday only to be told it was off because of the hotel being busy and lack of staff but we could hire a car for 85 euro a day which by the way just happened to be a BMW and were told this would be the cheapest option however the transfer price to Monte Lussari is cheaper the car hire (being busy was the staff being fully committed to the needs of and upcoming BMW event and not those of the guests) we then asked for another day and were told that the hotel would definitely arrange for us to go on Wednesday we agreed to this and were looking forward to it and got up early had breakfast were all dressed for skiing only for the owner and his wife (who had made the promise) not to even show up in the hotel and not make anyone aware we were meant to be going to Monte Lussari that morning.As a result we abandoned Italy and spent a lovely morning at Lake Jasna which is well work a visit.After dinner drinks is another sore point basically if you fancy a drink in the hotel after your meal you had better be quick because its not the done thing in this Hotel, the priority after dinner is not to serve the guests or make them feel at home it is to turn the lights off and lock up for the night. this we encountered on 2 nights in particular the first when we had been to venice for the day and came back and had our evening meal and wanted to stay in the restaurant for a few drinks and unwind after a fab day but the staff were not about to allow this to happen , the tidying up began around us making us feel like we had to move so we went to the reception area to have our drinks and use the wifi (as we couldn't always get wifi in our room) only to have Ana turn off all the lights and start locking the doors to the hotel leaving us in the dark and no way of buying another drink i wouldn't mind but it was only just after 10pm !!!!!The next was on our last night we came down and had our evening meal which was nothing to write home about and went for a night ski we got back to the hotel at 930pm and had arranged to have a drink at 10pm with the head waiter so we went to our room got changed and came back down at 10pm to find the hotel in darkness and the restaurant closed and door locked and no staff anywhere to be seen, so we had to resort to a visit to the next door Hotel Lipa who were more than happy to see us were so welcoming and cleared a table for us to have a drink and put no pressure on us to leave and it felt like the staff would have stayed all night serving us had we wanted too, the worst part of that night was when another guest from the Hotel Skipass came into the LIPA asking for milk for his young son for his bedtime bottle because he couldn't get any in the Skipass because it was locked up.Its sad to see such a change in a hotels ethos in 12 months, last year the owners couldn't do enough for us as guests but this year it felt like we were in the way almost an inconvenience, as all the hotels focus appeared to be on a BMW event and not the Hotel Guests.The hotel gives the impression of a small family run hotel but it appears that the owners have different priorities than the enjoyment of the hotel guests.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871

Wonderful Christmas Holiday;5;3.01.2016;We stayed in room 104 and the views of the mountains were beautiful. The room is large and modern, and our son was accommodated on a very decent sofa bed. There is Sky television with many English speaking channels.The whole stay was great, we were warmly greeted everyday and received a very personal service, which made being away at Christmas even more special. The hotel is only a 5 minute walk from the slopes, and we hired a locker through Inter Sport to store our skiing equipment.Breakfast was self service, a plentiful selection of cereals, breads, cheeses and hams etc. Eggs, sausages and pancakes can all be cooked to order. Afternoon tea and biscuits is lovely, with fresh cakes or biscuits everyday. Dinner is spectacular and you are in for a treat, fine dinning every night, it has been hard to return home to reality. Christmas dinner was a 5 course delight.

A small hotel set in a great location providing good quality accommodation to explore this wonderful part of Slovinia.;5;7.10.2015;Although we visited Slovinia at a quiet time of the year we found enough activities to do during our visit .We chose this hotel based on previous reviews and were not disappointed.The hotel is new ,modern but retains a friendly atmosphere.The hotel staff were all friendly,helpful and professional about their business.Breakfast is buffet style with plenty of good fresh choice and a wide selection of cooked food is offered to order.Evening meals are waitress served with only a small choice offered but the quality of food cooked,presented and served is of high restaurant standard.The house wine is also worth a mention in particular the red.Our room was always kept clean and tidy with plenty of toiletries and good fixtures and fittings throughout.With the hotel being located very near to the local bus station transport to other towns and villages in the area is very easy.There is the occasional noise of buses coming and going.To reach the town centre by foot is a 10 minute walk maximum.The town itself has plenty of bars and restaurants and is set in stunning scenery being a great base to explore the immediate area .We completed many of the well defined and sign posted walks enabling us to enjoy the mountains,lakes,rivers and fields which are a feature of Kranska Gora.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871

Gorgeous boutique hotel with an amazing a la carte restaurant;5;3.09.2015;There's a very good reason the Skipass Hotel is at the top on tripadvisor, I can't fault it. The hotel & food are both amazing but it's the staff which really make the hotel special. You're made to feel really appreciated and accommodated for in a genuine family run hotel. The staff are warm & friendly with great local advice on your stay. They also speak several languages which makes it easy for everyone to plan activities & book excursions. You even feel like you get to know their cute little dog :)The rooms are very clean & modern with large walk in showers, double beds, large flat screen TV and balconies offering amazing mountain views. The a la carte restaurant has gorgeous food, made from local food sources. We had a choice of 2 dishes for every meal and were never disappointed. We were extremely impressed with both the quantity & variety - in 10 days we didn't have the same meal twice. Also, we loved the Slovenian wine so much that we bought a box to take home. Non-residents can also dine in the restaurant which also features special summer tasting evenings with live music - a must if you're nearby! The hotel is owned by the Skipass Travel company so they operate their own excursions rather than you requiring public transport. We visited Lake Bled with them and it was a really efficient trip to see a truly amazing lake & medieval castle. The hotel and has it's own bike, ski and car rental along with being located near the bus terminus in the town/village of Kranska Gora. KG is located on a main highway and is on the cycle path which connects Slovenia to Italy. Off this path are numerous walking/hiking and cycling routes of different ability. The town is overlooked by the Julian Alps with many ski slopes which often double as walking routes during the summer. You can also visit the 3 borders (Slovenia/Italy/Austria) as we did on bike, although this quite a steep route. There are also local waterfalls, lakes and (soon to be) the world's largest ski jump Planica easily within walking/cycling distance. Kranska Gora is a small town but has many 'well reviewed' restaurants, bars, cafes etc plus several sports shops in case you need more kit. Having had an amazing 10 night stay here I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get out and see some amazing European sights and nature at it best. Plus that's just in Summer, I imagine that in Winter ski season, the whole town is buzzing!;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871

Great place for exploring the Julian Alps.;5;18.07.2015;Lovely family run hotel. Staff were exceptionally helpful and friendly. Room lovely and bright with French doors opening onto a private balcony with views to the mountains. However the room was quite hot and when leaving open the doors to allow in a breeze it was a little noisy from the restaurant below and the bus station across the road. The glass doors and windows are double glazed so once shut no noise could be heard. The restaurant food was amazing, although a little on the expensive side when compared to other restaurants in Kranjska Gora. Breakfast was fantastic with many choices of delicious seed and wholemeal breads and buns, cereals, nuts and seeds, yoghurt, fresh fruit, cheeses and cold meat and you can order eggs cooked any way - I can recommend the vegetable omelette. It was delicious. It was a treat to find that on our return after breakfast our room had already been serviced. The hotel has bicycles to hire and there are scenic flat bike tracks to the left and right of Kranjska Gora to other small villages in the valley. There is also easy access to walking trails. We took advantage of the hotel shuttle van transfer to Tarvisio Boscoverde train station at a cost of 45 euros to travel on to Venice.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871

Hotel Skipass created the sun that we lacked;5;26.06.2015;"What a lovely hotel and we were so glad we chose it ... and this is why ... We were unlucky in arriving in Kranjska Gora on an exceptionally wet week (just after some hot sunny weather). The balcony with stunning views was never used but a photo at 5am shows how it could be and we will be back in an instant to enjoy the most perfect food and service which more than compensated for the rain. The quality of ingredients at breakfast and evening meals was superb. The presentation was star quality (but please, Skipass chef, don't go down the Michelin route - your style is far superior) and the friendly service, especially at breakfast, was the icing on the cake. My highlights at breakfast: pancakes made to order, fresh fruit & juices, homemade preserves, excellent, plentiful coffee.Evening meal on our package had a meat & vegetarian choice for starter & main course; no choice for dessert - no problem, always perfect. All were with quality, local ingredients, delicious & a work of art.OK, if I must be completely objective, not everyone may enjoy the alarm call of bus noise that is the down-side of being so convenient to the bus stop and having a wonderful mountain view. We couldn't adjust the mini fridge in the room to a cool temperature - could be a problem when it's hot.But we loved the hotel, thank you and the surrounding scenery is superb; we look forward to basking in it in full sun!";Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
First Rate;5;26.06.2015;We found everything about this hotel was first class: the quality of the room furnishings, the view of Julian Alps from the balcony (room 103), the room service (clean towels and sheets every day) and of course the restaurant.

Note the fridge in the rooms is thankfully completely silent so at best keeps the contents cool rather than cold.All in all we had a superb weeks stay at the Skipass hotel.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871

The food is superb and for four people with different tastes our every wish was catered for. The rooms and all around the hotel spotlessly clean and breakfast to die for. The walking around the area is the best and to be situated near to the bus stop is a definite plus. We will definitely be returning next year.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
Superb hotel;5;6.06.2015;We have just returned from a wonderful week at the Skipass (booking through Thomsons Lakes and Mountains). It is absolutely superb, spotlessly clean, set in a lovely position on the edge of the village with great views of the mountains.

Superb Hotel and Restaurant with fantastic hospitality;5;26.05.2015;To the Justin FamilyThank you so much for making Tim and I's first visit to Kranjska Gora and Skipass such a welcoming homely and friendly stay. To all those who read this review I can not recommend this place highly enough. The Justin family run this small but personal hotel. They boost great space and its built all in keeping with the architectural feel of the area. Much has been thought out in design from its build 2 years ago. The views from the rooms at the front of the hotel are of the mountains. Bathrooms very fresh clean and with walk in shower. The hotel is very proud of the awards they have won in their restaurant and all credit goes to the Chef's and staff to make this possible. My husband and I stayed at the beginning of the Spring season on their culinary stay deal. This included a taster menu of 4 courses and 3 course on other nights. A very well thought our menu was served with excellent presentation and flavour. The house wine is excellent.From the moment we arrived we were provided with excellent service and attention to detail. We hired bikes from the hotel for one day and biked into Italy on the well served cycle path that runs close to the hotel. Tremendous views available on route. There are endless walking paths from the hotel and the centre of Kranjska Gora which is about 3 minute walk from this hotel. There are local restaurants, coffee places and bars in the town. We visited outside of the main tourism season but was still well catered for with many outdoor activities available. The hotel offers a personal and direct collection from the airport in Ljubliana. We will be looking to stay here again next year and are already thinking of returning for the ski season. Many thanks Nina and all the family....keep well;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
A five star treatment;5;25.03.2015;Once again the staff in the Skipass hotel seized to amaze us with their hospitality. Not only is the winter season ending, the weather is not doing a favour to all the tourism workers in Kranjska Gora also, but still we received a five star treatment while having dinner (and what a dinner it was!) in the renowned hotel Restaurants. All compliments to the chef, to the Restaurant workers and a huge thanks to the owners. A warm recommendation to all of you who hesitate to visit Kranjska Gora in spring - it has a lot to offer! Among which, the stay or at least a visit in the Skipass Hotel shouldn't be left out of your list!;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871

nice;5;5.03.2015;My first impression was warm family feeling, lot of light, warm and friendly ambient. At my staying there this feeling stays with me all the time. you can feel that family feeling is important. When you meet owners you realize way. It is a pleasant place to relax with partner, small kids or group of friends on a motorcycle passing trough Alps. Good destination to stay few days and have a daily trip to surrounding destination. On this review i have to mention perfect food, freshly cooked every time. Great effort of kitchen chef gives smooth and testy feeling to all dishes.

Simply the best!;5;2.03.2015;From my experience I can only say that the Skipass hotel is simply the best, one of the best ones in Slovenia! It offers you beautiful rooms, amazing restaurant and its unique culinary experience, and many more! The staff is amazing and even more are the hotels owners-they treat every guest as family during their stay. And of course you can't forget the dogs-Joy and Jani-who provide entertainment every day:) The Skipass hotel is truly a great experience in every way!;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
Truly Amazing!!!;5;26.02.2015;We stayed in your hotel a few weeks back (Rooms 105 and 106) and I would just like to say thank you for such a truly memorable stay. From the minute we arrived to minute we left you all made us feel at home. From the reception staff, the waiters and the chiefs, everything was perfect and the food was out of this world!!!! The room was also beautiful and was always spotlessly clean. In fact, we have all agreed that this was the THE BEST hotel we had all ever stayed in. Well done for creating such a stunning hotel and atmosphere. Location is also spot on, only a 5 minute walk from the centre of town and the slopes.Please pass on our thanks to all staff and tell them they made our holiday better than we could ever have imagined.We will definitely be staying again!!!!Thanks and see you again soon :);Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
A Jewel in Slovenia;5;22.02.2015;We just got home last night after an amazing holiday (our first for 8 years). We were unsure of which resort to go to for our first skiing holiday and it was the hotel that sealed the deal for us. We were not disappointed. The rooms are clean, warm and very comfortable. The food was out of this world and we tried and enjoyed dishes that we wouldn't normally have chosen. The staff were very friendly and we must give a special mention to Metod our waiter for most of the week. The most charming young man and a real asset to the hotel. It was only a flat leisurely 10min walk to the ski slopes and was nice to be away from the more commercial area of the town. We had a very early departure and were given a lovely packed lunch for our trip back to Salzburg airport.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871

"\Skiing 2015...fantastic hotel....we will be back\""""";5;15.02.2015;We recently returned from our first visit to Slovenia. The Skipass Hotel in Kranjska Gora was our home for a week and we had a truly amazing time, the staff, food,service and effortless hospitality from the Justin Family was a real treat.Everybody is on the same page when it comes to delivering a top class service and product. The food in particular deserves a special mention, we recommend half board as the evening meals on offer were out of this world. Every evening we were treated to an outstanding dining experience that three weeks later we are still speaking about. Kranskja Gora is a beautiful village with amazing little places for a quiet drink in the evening with excellent value for money. The hotel is a 10 - 12 minute walk from the chair lifts, we recommend renting a locker close to the lifts as it will save time bringing your equipment up and down each day. We are already planning a return trip next year to Kranskja Gora and Skipass Hotel,we cannot wait!!!;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871

Wonderful!;5;9.02.2015;This was our first holiday to Slovenia & it was definitely beyond our expectations. Hotel Skipass lived up to all the positive reviews. So much so, we have just re-booked for next year! As has been described, the food, service & overall accommodation was superb. The Justin family who run the hotel are very warm and welcoming (including Jani).

Lovely family run hotel in a fantastic setting.;5;8.02.2015;We were looking for a cheapish ski/snowboarding holiday and stumbled across what looked like a modern and stylish hotel in one of Europe's cheaper resorts. We booked via the Crystal website and we stayed half board and paid a little extra for a mountain view. We arrived at the hotel around 10.30pm and the bar and kitchen had shut, we were met by a very friendly member of staff who was very informative and had left food in our very nice modern room as we had missed dinner. The room we had was very spacious and well equipped, had large floor to ceiling doors to a balcony and that view we had paid extra for! A modern bathroom with a fantastic shower was great after a long day snowboarding, the room was a great space to relax. The food was exceptional, breakfast consisted of continental style buffet as well as egg, bacon and sausage cooked to order. Dinner was also cooked to order and each evening, we were given a choice of two starters & two mains as well as a dessert. This doesn't sound like a big choice (and its not) but there were clean plates every meal time. The dishes could not be faulted the chefs there are excellent, there was a real mix of food - salads, pasta, steak, rabbit, fish, risotto, soups, vegetarian & traditional Slovenian dishes. The choice of just two dishes per course could trip some people up, we found it fine and loved every meal there. The wine at the hotel was also excellent and the owners/staff were very proud of the Slovenian wine available.The location of the hotel is very good, around a 5mins walk to the old town square and 10min walk to the main chairlifts of Kranjska Gora. The ski slopes can be seen from the hotel. The town sits in a valley, the hotel has views of the mountains on both sides.The best part of this hotel is the friendly family and their staff who run it. We were always greeted with smiles and a great service from everyone who served us. They are very proud of their hotel it is shown by the way they treat you. They were helpful when it came to any issues (we had a small problem with a safe in one of the rooms, which was dealt with professionally), any questions we had they answered well and honestly. Skiing holidays can be expensive, you will never find a hotel of this quality and level of service (in my opinion) at this price in France/Switzerland/Italy etc... it will probably cost you double! Great value for money in a stunning part of the world.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
A charming retreat in Kranjska Gora;5;6.02.2015;We stayed here again for two nights and it was a nice experience. On arrival at the Skipass Hotel, we were warmly greeted by owners.

This hotel is the best we've ever stayed in!;5;22.01.2015;I am genuinely struggling to find the words to describe how fantastic this hotel is. We arrived on the 10th of January and we stayed for 1 week, on arrival to the hotel we were given a very warm welcome and handed a map with the best places to visit on. (Which was very helpful). Our room was a mountain view room, which was amazing, so much room and very warm after coming in from the cold. The window in the bedroom looking out onto the mountain was spectacular, it was a huge floor to ceiling room, which meant we could open up the curtains and enjoy the whole view from the warmth of our room. The food.... well! Wow! It was some of the best food i've ever had. They were so accomodating aswell (especially our waiter for a few of the evenings, Matod). My husband and I felt like we were eating like king and queen. I was poorly for the first few nights of our holiday aswell, but nothing was too much for them, they didnt mind that one evening i didnt eat at all and the other they prepared a completely different dish for me so that i could have plain food. But after that, i enjoyed every single meal i ate there. Including breakfast which was a great selection, with even the option for cooked food like eggs + sausage and pancakes and chocolate! I have already told everyone i know about this hotel and we are 100% planning to come back and stay! Thank you to all the staff here for such a fantastic holiday!!;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
Fantastic hotel & exceptional food;5;14.01.2015;We loved the Skipass hotel - our mountain view room was huge, everything spotlessly clean, the bed, bedding and pillows were super comfortable, the modern bathroom was amazing (including under floor heating and shower pressure to equal even the best US hotels!) and there was loads of storage space (handy when you're on a ski trip). The only thing missing for us was a kettle (we both had stinking colds so hot drinks/lemsips in the room would've been nice).We booked half board through Crystal Ski so I can't comment on the a la carte menu, but based on what we had in the restaurant the food was exceptional and the staff were really accommodating if there were things we didn't like. Excellent selection at breakfast (including bringing me freshly squeezed lemon to help with my cold - so kind) and they even made us a packed lunch for our 6am pick up on the last day.It's a good 10-15 mins walk to the ski lifts in all your gear, so although there's a secure drying room in the basement we opted for a locker at the bottom of the slopes for 6 euros a day. Money well spent! And enough room to dry/store loads of gear - more than enough for 2 of us, probably enough for 4 lots of boots, skis/boards etc.The regular bus service to Bled and Ljubljana goes from right outside, the reception team (in fact everyone there) are really helpful if you need travel/local info, and there's a supermarket and cash point (plus bakery and sports shop) 2 mins walk away. Or the main street with banks, shops, bars etc is less than 10 mins walk away (if you're not in ski boots).;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871

Excellent hotel;5;21.12.2014;We originally planned to stay for a long weekend in September and ended up spending an entire week. We have a five-year-old son and the place is children-friendly. Skipass is a small boutique family-run hotel. All family members work there, making the service all that better. Really spacious and clean rooms full of light thanks to large ceiling-to-floor and wall-to-wall windows. The morning view out can make you forget it's time for breakfast. So keep your eyes on your watch in the morning. The hotel restaurant is probably the best in Kranjska Gora. I'm sure we'll go back there and stay at Skipass.

Great hotel;5;20.10.2014;We stayed at Skipass Hotel on a half-board basis for seven nights in October 2014. We had previously visited the area several times in summer for walking and mountain scenery. The hotel is very clean, in a good location, and food is presented to a very high standard with excellent Slovenian wines. This Kranjska Gora hotel is perhaps unusual in being both a small family hotel with only ten rooms, and also modern and sophisticated with up-to-date facilities.The hotel is very good value, and highly recommended.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
One of my favourite hotels;5;11.09.2014;"A really excellent hotel. Beautiful chalet just at the side of the lovely town in Kranjska Gora. About a 3 minute walk to the central square. It is a small, welcoming, professionally run chalet, just ten rooms. The staff are all very lovely and speak English, among other languages. The rooms are simple but attractive and comfortable. Lovely views of the mountains. (Two small criticisms: no airconditioning meant it was a bit too warm overnight in August, and there was no kettle in the room.) The restaurant area downstairs is really well designed, very modern yet alpine looking, and has an outdoor terrace too. The food is excellent. Beautiful buffet breakfast, with eggs, meat etc cooked to order. They even started breakfast early for us when we wanted to do very long hikes. Dinner is of a very high standard, and certainly the best in the town. The hotel was offering a very good 3 course menu for 20 euros (two options for each course); a la carte worked out slightly more but had some delicious and beautifully presented dishes.";Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871

Highly recommended!;5;9.08.2014;Absolutely stunning new property in Kranjska Gora. From the moment we crossed the main entrance we were greeted with polite, friendly and efficient service. This hotel really is as good as everyone says, so relaxing and peaceful. The staff were exceptionally helpful, the rooms were fantastic, and the breakfast buffet was extraordinary, so was the dinner with very harmonic flavors.

Unique;5;21.07.2014;The hotel is unique. Servis was Excellent you can feel hospitality from family Justin. I was very impressed by the food especially the desserts. The rooms are very beautifful. I really recommend that you visit hotel if you are in Kranjska Gora.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
Fantastic Hotel and Restaurant;5;21.07.2014;"Stayed in Skipass Hotel for 2 weeks in July 2014 on half board basis in twin/double room with balcony on first floor. Room is very spacious with walk-in shower/wet room and full range of wardrobes with ample hangers, shelves and drawers. The beds are very comfortable, being two single mattresses in a purpose built frame which amounts to a huge double bed. Rooms on the first floor have view south from the balcony towards the Julian Alps. Balcony has 2 comfortable chairs and plenty of space to sit comfortably.The greatest feature of the hotel is the staff, led by the Justin family. The family and the other team members all provided excellent service; nothing was too much trouble and anything could be arranged for a fair price, e.g. a taxi for 2 to the nearby Austrian border for €15 and to Bled (4 people for €12 each return).The breakfasts were fantastic with a full range of continental breakfast options, copious fresh fruit, outstanding croissants on most days, and brilliant cooked options including omelettes, pancakes, eggs cooked any way you want, etc, etc. The half-board dinners were 3 courses, with a choice of 2 starters, 2 mains, and a sweet (on the one occasion that the sweet was not to our taste an alternative was readily provided). There was no repeat during the 2 weeks of our stay. The portion sizes were not huge, but perfect to leave us replete but not bloated after a full day's walking. One could order from the full a-la-carte menu as an extra cost option if required, but we never felt the need. The quality of the food was clear evidence of the skill of the chef (one of the top 5 in Slovenia) and his staff.During our stay the hotel was never busy which suited us perfectly as we prefer the quiet atmosphere and personal service that was provided.The hotel is situated on the edge of the town right next to the bus station; don't be put off by this as the bus station is really just the main bus stop for the town, never noisy, and the out of town setting made it a quiet place which we prefer.On the ground floor are reception, the bar/restaurant, and the terrace. The hotel has just 10 rooms; six on the first floor each with a balcony, and on the second floor two double/twin rooms without balcony, and two suites. We understand that the rooms on the second floor are even larger than those on the first, but we can't speak from personal experience. We love the quietness, and the personal service that we received. We heartily recommend the hotel.Minor niggles: the mini-bar fridge was never really cold; the hotel directory was in Slovenian with no English translation, and the wi-fi signal was weak. These factors in no way spoilt our holiday.Kranjska Gora is perfectly placed for a walking holiday, with many walks from the town itself and from nearby villages readily accessible by public transport. Transfer from the airport in Ljubljana took just over an hour including a stop en-route at another hotel in Bled.";Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
Fantastic hotel beautiful location;5;20.07.2014;We stayed at the Skipass hotel for one week in July, it is a small family run hotel overlooking the Julian Alps, it has a great location just minutes walk from the town centre. We found Kranjska Gora to be a lovely, clean, well maintained place and quiet even though there were people round and about. A great place for walking/hiking in the summer. The hotel is one that we would highly recommend, it was spotlessly clean and well maintained and the Justin family made us feel very welcome, their passion and commitment shone through. The restaurant was outstanding with fabulous service from the family and also the waiter Method needs a particular mention for his very professional but friendly manner. The food was of gourmet standard with each dish being prepared with great attention to detail. Breakfast each day was also of a very high standard with plenty of choice. Nothing was too much trouble in the hotel it had a professional but homely atmosphere, if you choose to stay here you really won't be disappointed.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
luxury with a view to the Julian Alps;5;8.07.2014;we spent few days cycling in the area and stayed in Skipass Hotel. Family Justin did a realy god joob to build this hotel, which is one of the best in the region. Is a small hotel with 8 rooms and 2 deluxe suite, every room has a breath taking view to the Julian Alps. As well they have a realy nice three counties restaurant, the food is fantastic. If you travel to Kranjska Gora you need to visit this hotel or just stop for a lunch. We will defenetly come back next year.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
THE BEST CHOICE!;5;7.07.2014;I do a lot of research before selecting a hotel and the Skipass Hotel fulfilled the promises and revews made by people who had stayed there before. The position close to the city center, overlooking the Julian Alps and within easy reach to the ski slopes, make this hotel one with absolutely no regrets! From the tasteful decor to the helpful and friendly service and the gourmet offerings of the restaurant, the Skipass Hotel puts it all together for a wonderful stay in the small town of Kranjska Gora.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
Exceptional;5;6.07.2014;Look no further, you have found the best hotel in Kranjska Gora and possibly in Slovenia! An immaculate, beautifully designed, very well run, family hotel. It is in a great location near the centre of town but quiet, the bus stop nearby and glorious views of the mountains. The rooms are spacious and well appointed with a walk in shower. Breakfast is a generous varied buffet and the evening meal is 3 courses with a range of dishes superbly presented and served. All the staff, mostly family, are friendly, good humoured and very helpful, ready to offer assistance with anything you might need. An absolute gem, our stay was a treat from start to finish.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
Faultless;5;4.07.2014;We stayed here for a weeks skiing based on the great reviews and we weren't disappointed. The hotel is modern and clean. It is family run and they go out of their way to make you feel at home. We had a room on the top floor at the back and whilst it did not have a balcony and view of the hills it was lovely. The room was plenty big enough and the bathroom and shower were a good size too. The bathroom floor was heated which helped with drying wet gloves. As for the food, this is where this place really excels. We were half board and had a 3 course meal every night. We were glad we weren't charged excess baggage on the flight home for the weight we put on. I'm a vegetarian and chef put a lot of thought and effort into making varied and delicious meals, and not a lasagne in sight. We got ski lockers at the bottom of the slopes which was handy as it's no fun carting ski gear backwards and forwards to the slopes. If you come the Kranjska Gora you have to stay here.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
Loved it;5;4.07.2014;We chose the Hotel Skipass after reading some good rewievs on tripadvisor and waren't dissapointed. Is for sure one of the best in Kranjska Gora. The architecture is modern but very cosy, it feels like being home just in another place. The family who runs the hotel is realy very nice and always there if you need something. The rooms are big and have a lot of space and the wiev to the Julian Alps is just amazing. I can't forget the food, the chefs did a perfect job every day. They have tree countries menu and the food is fantastic.We loved this place and definetly come back soon.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
Best hotel in town;5;2.07.2014;We have visited Kranjska Gora and Skipass Hotel in Kranjska Gora with my family. When we arrived we have seen that we actually choose the best hotel in town. Arhitecture and design of a new family hotel was really more than we expected. Everybody was very professional and friendly. Hotel very clean with beautifull view, spacious rooms with balcony.

Superb Hotel and Well Looked After;5;26.06.2014;We have just spent a week in Slovenia, staying at the Hotel & Restaurant Skipass, Kranjska Gora. Great welcome and excellent service. This family run hotel in my opinion is the best in the area, with fine dining and top class accommodation. The staff could not have been more attentive and we were made to feel at home from the outset.Great friendly atmosphere, with a professional service throughout. We were made to feel at home and advised on the best places to visit, this information helped us enjoy our holiday all the more.Thanks to all Rob and Lesley, J.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871

The staff were the perfect combination of friendly and professional, really went out of their way to make the stay enjoyable.

We will definitely be back, and would recommend it to anyone thinking of taking a trip to Kranjska Gora.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
Great location and Gourmet food;5;8.03.2014;Myself and my boyfriend stayed here for a week in February - booked through Crystal. The room and facilities were clean, modern and spacious. The family run hotel is relaxed and welcoming. Although only a 5 minute walk to the slopes we hired a locker at inter sport at the slopes for 30 euros a week. This is well worth the money as it saves you carrying all your gear and you can fit up to 4 lots of boots and skis in the locker. We used the sauna one afternoon after skiing and had it all to ourselves along with a variety of teas and snacks. The food was truly outstanding, some of the best food I have ever had. We were half board so we had 2 choices of starters and mains and a desert. Every meal was excellent and breakfast was equally good with a continental selection and made to order eggs, sausages and pancakes. I would highly recommend this small hotel - you really won't be disappointed.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
Excellent short ski break;5;5.03.2014;We decided to re-visit Kranjska Gora after having a lovely holiday there last year. Having reviewed hotels, we thought we would book to stay at the Skipass Hotel and what a good decision that was. The hotel has 10 bedrooms and is run by a family. The hotel is quite new (built in 2012), has a sauna and free wifi and safe. It is close to the village and ski area, about a 5 minutes walk. We contacted the hotel prior to arriving to see whether they could recommend anybody for airport transfers. We heard straight back and the family offered to do the transfers themselves. Very quick and easy, only about 40 minute transfer so before we knew it, we were out skiing. The hotel is very friendly, spotlessly clean with excellent food and a lovely walk in power shower. We booked on a bed and breakfast basis, but decided to eat at the hotel on our last night, the food was superb, just wished we had eaten there earlier. Also a nice bar area for a chilled out evening drink. The family were always on hand offering advice and wanting to make sure everything and everybody in our group was ok. We were recommended by one of the locals to try a ski away day, where a lot of the locals ski 'Vogel'. We asked at reception the best way to get there and they again offered to drive us there, to save us having to pay for a taxi which would have been quite expensive. We had an excellent days skiing and were then driven back to the hotel, after also being driven through Bled to allow us to see some of the famous sights. The village of Kranjska Gora may be small but has several apres ski bars at the bottom of the slopes, several bars and restaurants in the village with very friendly locals. We made some new friends, one of whom was the National Ski Champion for 9 years, who offered and showed us some tips/new techniques to improve our skiing. We have only been back 2 days and are already looking to book again for next year. We cannot recommend the Skipass Hotel enough. Thank you to all of the family for looking after us during our recent stay and making our break enjoyable. We may pass on the Grappa family shot though next time haha;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
Fantastic hotel;5;23.02.2014;We had a lovely week here, the rooms are spacious, really clean and nicely done out. The food and wine choices were excellent with a range of freshly prepared different dishes to chose from each night. The location of the hotel is perfect, only a short walk to the slopes/town centre and the bus stop is right outside perfect for any local sightseeing you want to do. The staff could not have been more helpful and we would definitely recommend this as the best hotel in Kranjska Gora.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
A perfect gem!;5;15.02.2014;I just returned from the most amazing week long break at Skipass hotel! The hotel itself is small, only ten rooms, and run by a lovely Slovenian family in a very picturesque setting in Kranjska Gora. Location - It is about a five minute walk from the slopes. There is a room down stairs you can keep your skis however we decided to rent a locker for 30 euro a week right on the slopes to save dragging them back and fore! Again it’s a three minute walk from the town where there is a small supermarket and a few bars. The beer and wine is very cheap in the area with a 500ml local beer being around 2 Euros and 100ml of decent wine 1.5 Euro. Room - Really lovely, modern, clean and more than big enough for two with a good sized flat screen. Service - We received a lovely warm welcome and all the family regularly checked in to ask if we were enjoying our holiday. The waiting staff were also excellent. Our bus left at 4.45 AM and a member of staff was up to make sure we had a cup of tea and packed lunch before we left! Dining - This is where the hotel really comes into its own. The food was some of the best I have ever had! The breakfast was a buffet with a good selection and you could order eggs any way you cared for as well as pancakes. The dinner was a set three course meal with a choice of two options for starters and mains. I was a little apprehensive being a vegetarian however the chef far exceeded my expectations with a delightfully different and inventive menu every single evening! This is real fine dining with the food not only being delicious but also beautifully presented. Skiing - My boyfriend and had never skied before and had an amazing time learning to ski in Kranjska each doing red runs by the end of the week! There is not an endless supply of runs but more than enough for beginners or those of intermediate level. The tuition and equipment arranged by Crystal was also good. Overall we had an amazing time and would certainly recommend this hotel without a moment’s hesitation.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
Outstanding!!;5;2.02.2014;We stayed in Hotel Skipass from 11-18th January and what an amazing time we had! On our arrival, despite being at 11pm, we were warmly greeted and instantly felt very welcome. Our room was superb, extremely comfortable, beautifully clean with lots of space and a lovely balcony looking out over the pistes. The food was wonderful, we tried to choose our favourite dish but couldn't. Each dish prepared with great attention to detail, tasting equally as delicious as the last and served by the excellent waiter Mefod, for whom nothing was too much trouble. It was a real pleasure to meet the delightful family who run Hotel Skipass, their commitment and passion is evident throughout.

High level;5;26.01.2014;We spent 10 days at the Skipass hotel in January. Before our trip we read a lot about hotels in Kranska Gora and we thought that Skipass hotel is one of best. No, there is no doubt Skipass is THE BEST. In this hotel you may find originally designed rooms and perfect restaurant, very modern sauna and comfortable parking, etc. Everything is perfect... Also In this hotel you may rent ski equipment and rent a car, buy skipasses not only for skiing in Kranska Gora and also in many places in Austria and in Italy. Skipass hotel is a family hotel. The owners organised everything is their hotel in a fantastic way, that is why the atmosphere there is always homelike!

Amazeballs!!!!;5;25.01.2014;We stayed with ski-pass from 11th-18th January, and it was honestly one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed at. This was the our first holiday to Slovenia and despite the lack of snow in Kranjska Gora the holiday did not disappoint, this was only due to having such an excellent hotel. The a la carte dinners were outstanding to say the least and the rooms were flawless. We were given an upgraded room when we got to the hotel with beautiful views of the mountains!!!The staff were lovely and nothing was to much trouble, we didn't get the waiters name but he defiantly deserves a mention as he did an excellent job every dinner time and the odd morning at breakfast.I want to thank all the staff for a fantastic holiday and we will be seeing you again for sure!!!

Great Hotel;5;28.12.2013;I traveled with my family from Singapore to Slovenia in order to ski, and, in this regard, Skipass hotel did not fail to deliver. Not only was the hotel able to dispatch a van to pick us up from Austria, they were able to get us our skis, poles and helmets as well as help in booking instructors and providing storage for our gear. The convenience of this cannot be overstated.The hotel restaurant was also excellent, providing good food and excellent service (special thanks to Metod, the waiter). The rooms were spacious, clean, well stocked and had a great view as well. On a personal note, I liked the decor as it was both modern and warm.Last, but absolutely not least, I found that the family running the hotel were some of the best hosts and friendliest people I have ever met and their dogs Yani and Joy made the hotel feel like a home in another land.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871

Great Hotel;5;27.09.2013;We stayed in this hotel for three nights. We booked hotel cause it had very good reviews and this is perfectly true. Family run hotel offering a very warm welcome and excellent service. Hotel is brand new, clean and special attention to details. It has great location and free parking.

Great Hotel that ticks all the boxes;5;26.09.2013;Decided to book this Hotel after reading all the very positive reviews here on Trip Advisor. We stayed here earlier this month with two of our friends and we were all very impressed with the high levels of customer service, quality of the accommodation, food and the location of the Hotel. This is a family run Hotel and the individual service you receive is excellent - we booked a white water rafting trip, mountain bike hire and a trip down to Lake Bled all through reception, everything was arranged for us with the minimum of fuss.We particularly enjoyed the breakfasts which along with the usual continental alternatives a range of hot options were available which were all cooked to order - the omelette's were particularly good with all manner of fillings.It was a pleasure to return your room after a day out, we paid extra for a room with a mountain view which had a decent sized balcony. The room was equipped with a fridge, 40 inch Sony Bravia T.V., a seating area with coffee table and mood lighting. The en-suite wet room had Boch and Viceroy fittings which incorporated a rain shower and a conventional one.Free Wi-fi is available throughout the hotel but the best signal is to be found near the reception area.All in all a great place to stay - I would have no hesitation in recommending this Hotel to any of our family and friends, we are well traveled and this Hotel is up with the best of them.Finally, I would just like to mention that we found the prices of the drinks, including the wine, to be very reasonable;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871

A Slovenian gem;5;22.08.2013;A last minute holiday destination turned out to be a delight. The Blane family are ideal hosts, and with their staff provided excellent service. They were interested in your day but not obtrusive and the hotel provides comfort, excellent cuisine and a position that provides stunning views of the Julian Alps. Being a new contemporary hotel the rooms are spotless, of a good size and provide a view to delight whether seeing the clouds draping the mountains or the blue skies providing a vivid backdrop to the jagged peaks.

Top notch hotel in Kranjska Gora;5;7.08.2013;"Having opened in December 2012, this boutique (10 room) hotel is a notch above others in Kranjska Gora, but only a little more expensive. Rooms are Scandinavian style and very confortable with balconies and great views of the mountains; owners and staff could not be more helpful; cuisine and wine are also pitched above the (albeit very good) pizza and schnitzel found elsehwere in KG. A great choice in summer and probably even better in winter for skiing as the owners' first business is all about skiing. Breakfast on the terrace is wonderful. Highly recommended.";Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
An amazing find - this world class small hotel;5;1.08.2013;Picture Danish modern design in a small hotel of just 10 rooms, a brilliant quality fitout with white walls, natural stone, pale lightly washed timber doors and floors, the finest quality fittings and furnishings - this is the Skipass Hotel. The rooms are spotlessly clean, flooded with natural light and with excellent access to the fresh air and great views via large windows and balconies. Set this in a beautiful the Slovenian valley of Zgornjesavska, surrounded by the towering peaks of the Triglav National Park - this is a really really good hotel.At first sight we were delighted to have chosen this hotel for a four day stay, but more so when we dined in the hotel restaurant. Simply amazing value for the standard of service and quality of food and wine offered. I would have expected to pay more than triple the pricing, and would not have been disappointed to do so. If you were served such a meal in Paris or London, New York or Sydney you too would be pleased.This is an embarrassingly enthusiastic review..... but it is well deserved. Slovenia was such a surprising place to me on this my first visit - the friendliness of its people, the sophistication of its society and the natural beauty of the country, together with its reasonable pricing, ensures it will not be my last. The offer from Hotel Skipass is totally consistent with this. This is a world class small hotel.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
A week in Kranjska Gora;5;20.07.2013;We had a wonderful week staying at the skipass hotel. It is only 9 months old & it looks fantastic. The family are very welcoming & would do anything to make feel at home.The room is very comfortable with a very plush bathroom, no bath but a terrific walk in shower.One thing we would have liked is a kettle to make tea in the room.Breakfast was buffet style. The evening meals were excellent with 3 courses & a choice of 2 for each course. In the afternoon after you come from a long you walk you can get tea & home made cake on the terrace at the front of the hotel. We looked at other hotels in the village but they are all large hotels & very dated. They should think about demolishing some of them & build new hotels with modern facilities. Our room 101 had a view straight up to the Julian Alps. If I could wake up to that view every day for the rest of my life I would be very happy.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
Great choice !;5;19.07.2013;Would thoroughly recommend this hotel for those looking for personal service , quality dining, modern clean accommodation , and fabulous views of the mountains.The family running the hotel all greeted us personally on arrival late in the evening , and with their staff made us very welcome throughout our stay.Breakfast options were very good and quality of evening meals surpassed our expectations.Dined at the hotel every evening and enjoyed some really excellent food, some evenings al fresco dining with mountain views.Good quiet location but only 5 minute walk to village centre.This is a gem of a hotel if you are looking for something different and real personal attention.Recommend tour of the Julian Alps with Crystal - stunning scenery and good value for money.;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871
Truly an unforgettable holiday:);5;25.06.2013;Me in my girlfriends spend in February a short weekend break in Kranjska Gora. We spent the holiday in the beautiful hotel Skipass and we were thrilled! The rooms are very large and modern with a huge bathroom. We also had a balcony with view to the ski slopes and the Julian Alps. The hotel has also got a restaurant that we were the most impressed! On the menu you will find practically everything from traditional Slovenian dishes and Italian pasta to seafood! The hotel owners are very friendly and will be happy to help you with information on ski resorts, hotels and attractions! At the hotel reception you can also buy ski passes for Kranjska Gora and to Austria and Italy!

Delicious dinner;5;11.02.2013;We only ate here but certainly the food was truly delicious!! It is a family run business, which gives it a a real personal vibe. The food is much more of a 'fine dinning' experience than any other restaurant in kranjska gora and serves very traditional Julian Alps (Austrian/Slovenian/Italian) cuisine. The owner takes you through what the dishes are and how they are traditional to the area, which is a nice touch and needed as some of the foods i couldn't even pronounce!! The food itself was unfaultable, beautifully cooked and absolutely delicious. We had white wine, also from Slovenia, i have to admit i wasn't sure about the quality of slovenian wine, but this was as nice a wine as i have tasted (and i have tasted a lot!!) it was almost like a French Sancerre and complemented my fish perfectly! We were also given a glass of their homemade schnapps, a nice touch but - wow, firewater!!!!!!Although a little more expensive than the other restaurants in kranjska gora (around €40 per head for 3 courses and wine) this meal was definitely worth every penny!I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting the resort!;Hotel & Restaurant Skipass;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotel&RestaurantSkipass;Koroshka ulica 14c, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4870265;13.7859871

Some rooms coils do with a touch of restoration but overall a positive experience. A tad boring if you have a gluten free diet but they do try to Accommodate ...

Comfortable Stay at Arena Resort & Spa;4;18.10.2016;We stayed here for two nights. The hotel has two sections, one of which is rated 3 stars and the new section is rated 4 stars. We stayed at a room in the new section. The room is not bad, service is ok. Breakfast selection is not as comprehensive as other hotels, with limited choices of cooked dishes. the hotel is located very close to the cable car station.

Fine for a short stay;3;3.09.2016;We stayed at this hotel for 2 weeks in August, we were in the newer section. Our room was a good size with a good size bathroom. There were no tea/coffee making facilities but there is a bar fridge. We asked for a kettle which they provided. No coffee or tea given and we were just given two cups no saucers from the bar at reception. Room service never cleaned these. Although the room and bathroom were clean I felt the room service could be better. Despite the notice about clean towels given only if left on the floor we got clean towels every day. We left laundry the one day which wasn't taken. The days the laundry was taken we had to collect from reception. There was no wifi in the room we had to go to the reception to get wifi. Breakfast buffet was ok, the same every morning. Dinner Buffet very unappetising we didn't even try it. A few of the staff speak fluent English but not all. The ski lifts did not work so their was no mountainside activities available except a walk up the mountain.

Disappointing;2;28.07.2016;My wife and I stayed here one night on our way to Portoroz, before I actually get to the review I want to say, your welcome to Slovenia starts at the border with it being the most expensive country in Europe to pass through, a 10 day vignette is 30 Euros and because we were there 10 days we had to pay 60 Euros for a months pass! They charge by height (anything over 1.3m is classed as a van).Anyway, we visited this hotel because my wife is ski mad and this hotel is at the bottom of the FIS Ski World Cup race, so you would assume this place would be pretty nice. Well far from it, we were in the cheaper Annex part, which reminded me more of a motel, small very dated rooms, the electronic door handle had wires sticking out of the top of it, and a tiny shower room and no toilet paper.The staff were not much better, the guy on the front desk did'nt even know what time the spa opened and closed, and the waitress was so slow I had to keep reminding her we wanted drinks.To top it all off, they had a football camp staying there, which consisted of between 30 - 50 men which made my wife very uncomfortable and put her off using the small spa the have, I think personally if you have groups as large as that staying then all booking guests should be informed.On a positive side, the terrace in beautiful, especially on a warm evening.the breakfast was OK, nice coffee.Thank god it was only a one night stay;Hotel Arena;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelArena;Pot k mlinu 57, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5322635;15.6028691
For winter and summer vacations;4;26.07.2016;The hotel is located close to the one ski-lift in Maribor, which is good in winter but also in the summer as they have a lot of trekking- and MTB/downhill slopes. I.e. when you are looking for an activity vacation. The price for a room for 3 persons was moderate, breakfast included. We also tried the hotel restaurant, fine but no extras. The breakfast could also offer slightly more variations.;Hotel Arena;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelArena;Pot k mlinu 57, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5322635;15.6028691

OK;3;16.09.2015;+ Large room, fitness center, good breakfast - nothing special, but there is variety of choice- The bed sheet looked like somebody had slept there - it was massy and had some hairs on it.

I regretted my choice;3;3.09.2015;We took a short hiking vacation in Pohorje, and Hotel Arena seemed a good choice. It's conveniently located at the bottom of a ski slope and within 2 minutes walk to the cable car. Presumably a very quiet location, which it turned out quite the opposite.The hotel consists of two parts, the newer one was renovated/built around 2008. I haven't seen the old rooms, but the new ones (we had two on the 1st floor) are neat, spacious and offer everything that you would need. The beds are very comfortable, bed linen is nice and the pillows are just right. We noticed a few glitches: a bed-side light missing, a broken light bulb, a weird stench in one of the bathrooms, some dust in an odd corner, but nothing major.Breakfast is ok and the restaurant was closed for dinner, but there is a choice of restaurants within walking distance.What killed my joy with the hiking vacation was noise.First, on Saturday, there was a sort of a festival with rock music in front of the hotel, some ten meters away, with a full stage of loudspeakers. 10:00 AM to 8:00 PM. No mercy for the hotel guests who mostly needed to evacuate on their own to survive. It was followed up by a wedding in hotel premises 40 m away, again in front of the hotel, with folk music at full blast until 4 AM. Again no mercy for the hotel guests. Clearly a very poor management decision to sacrifice paying hotel guests in order to gain some additional earning. There is no guarantee that such extra-events will not be organized at any point in the future. If the tourist model of the hotel/region presumes the hotel guests shouldn't rest during the day and sleep at nights, then this is clearly a tourist model which we will not take part in. Never again.;Hotel Arena;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelArena;Pot k mlinu 57, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5322635;15.6028691
Good location, but room needs refurbishment;3;10.07.2015;We stayed here for two nights during our roadtrip. Hotel is at a beautiful location, just at the end of a big skislope. Hiking and bikingfacilities are all over the place.We had a room 125 at the end of the corridor in the old building. Room certainly needs some refurbishment. All the furniture was outdated. The bathroom had broken shower walls and the shower was spraying the water all the way.If you come here. Ask for a room in the new building. They seem to be much better.;Hotel Arena;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelArena;Pot k mlinu 57, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5322635;15.6028691
Clean hotel;5;4.06.2015;This hotel was very clean and tidy, also price was quite attractive. Receptionists were kind and helpful, also the other staff seemed dilligent.

On the last day of our stay we were offered a late check-out free of charge, which was great and it enabled us to spend some extra time skiing.

Nice hotel for relaxation;5;26.10.2013;I have been there several times over last year, last time in June 2013. Hotel is having free parking and internet connection. Room itself is one of the best I’ve ever sleep in – clean, well equipped, and “traveller” friendly. Buffet breakfast is rich with freshly prepared eggs upon traveller request, dinner in restaurant is simply amazing (especially during summer if you can sit in outside terrace). Hotel team is friendly and well supportive, staff in restaurant with deep wine knowledge and ability to recommend the best wine to your meal. In summer, fully recommend to by walk straight to top of ski slope – amazing view on Maribor from top of ski slope. Planning to come to Maribor for romantic weekend with my wife, Arena will be surely my choice. Really nice hotel in amazing area for relaxation after busy business day.;Hotel Arena;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelArena;Pot k mlinu 57, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5322635;15.6028691
Great relax;4;3.09.2013;My hubby and I stayer There for just four nights last August and We had a nice experience. Breakfast Was good and plenty, the wellness areas clean and modern and included in the Price, 80 euros at night per Room. Most of staff is lovely and friendly, the hotel is close to sports facilities. The city of Maribor is 6 km far from it but fast to reach even by Bike that you can easily rent. Our Room Was cmfortable and big enough. The only drwback Was that they didn,t vacuum it for the 4 Days We stayed There. Anyway, We highly recommend it!;Hotel Arena;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelArena;Pot k mlinu 57, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5322635;15.6028691

great hotel for a ski vacation;4;16.03.2013;"We choose this hotel for a four day long family ski trip at the beginning of March. This period called \Boom Holidays\"" in this area, and this means you get super nice prices and a free ski pass. The hotel's location is fantastic, just at the end of the ski slopes. You can easily walk down to the cable car's station, but there is also a chair lift right next to the hotel. There is also a bus stop next to the cable car station, where you can take bus number 6 to the city center.The rooms are beautiful: dark wood furintures, cream and green colours, landscape pictures on the wall. The bathroom was big, clean and nicely decorated with floral tiles. There was a flat tv in the room, and the hotel provided free wi-fi. We had a huge terrace with outdoor furnitures.The boom holiday package came with halfboard: there was a big selection of foods at breakfast buffet and at the evening buffet too. At the dinner they give you cold water free of charge, and you don't even have to ask for it, which is a nice touch. Sometimes the restaurant gets a bit crowded, this may cause a little inconvenience. The wellness area is very relaxing, clean and cozy. There are saunas, jacuzzis and rest areas. For some people it could be confusing that the wellness area is swimwear free, but the hotel provides big and soft sauna towels, so you can hide in it if it's a problem for you. There is a nice selection of teas, fruits and lemonade here - they are included in the price of using the wellness area. All in all: I would definitely stay here again!""";Hotel Arena;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelArena;Pot k mlinu 57, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5322635;15.6028691

Pure excellene!;5;8.10.2012;Where can I start? Hotel is located on the slopes of Pohorje out side of Maribor. You can reach the city center with a 5 minute car ride. Hotel is right on the slopes. It has a beautiful view of the mountain. Hotel is really new and everything is excellent. Hotel staff was really friendly and eager to help. I told them that our trip was special and they threw roses all over the room. Great touch. Room is spacious with great king size bed. Lots of pillows and really comfy. Mini bar is really nicely stocked and the prices are descent. Bathroom OK. Wifi connection was excellent in the whole hotel. Breakfast was amazing and there are lots of choices of cold cuts, salads, cereal, yogurts, fruits, and hot plate with big variety of hot food. Spa is amazing! Lots of saunas, couple of whirpools and resting areas.Open late so you can enjoy it after a long day of walking around.

Great Hotel;5;9.09.2012;Got my room after canceling another reservation nearly 30% more expensive. This hotel offers great value for 56 euros per night (breakfast included). The room and the bathroom were big, modern and clean. The breakfast buffet offers several cold and hot options and there was no problem with the sitting space. The hotel has 2 lovely terraces where you can eat or have something to drink. To connect to the city center ( this hotel is located in an area great for skiing but outside the city center) there is a bus station 50m away. The buses ran every 15-20min, and it takes around 20min to get to the city center (the price per ticket is 1,10 euro). I can only recommend this hotel to everyone interested in getting a great experience for an even greater price!!!;Hotel Arena;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelArena;Pot k mlinu 57, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5322635;15.6028691

Beautiful location, staff and hotel;5;24.03.2012;Stayed here for 4 days to relax on a very last minute trip. I was concerned at what it would be like as it was very cheap but I need not have worried. Beautiful hotel, rooms very modern and clean. Spacious and bright. Actually stayed in 4 different rooms as originally was only staying for 2 nights but decided to stay on but had to move to different room. All rooms decorated slightly differently but still lovely. Big modern bathrooms too! Breakfast was lovely, lots of choice and very tasty. Gorgeous spa, small but clean, modern and everything you need to chill out. Treatments reasonably priced and I had a gorgeous body scrub by a lovely lady.As a single female traveller I was never made to feel uncomfortable and the staff really could not be more helpful.Heading back in May 2012 and would most definitely recommend this place!;Hotel Arena;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelArena;Pot k mlinu 57, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5322635;15.6028691

great breakfast, very nice staff, good value;5;3.09.2011;The place is great and the price is fantastic for what you get. I paid more than double for less than the half in other hotels. The best is the breakfast, lots to choose and you can seat outside if you want, and the staff, always willing to help.Something bad? Nothing that I can think of. I missed a garage, but I've been twice in this hotel by motorcycle and nobody ever touched it, so I guess there's no real need for it. And it is a bit outside the city, but it's just in front of the skying facilities if you're into such things.I will use it every time it's on my way without hesitation.;Hotel Arena;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelArena;Pot k mlinu 57, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5322635;15.6028691

Amazing location with the most terrible food and service;1;14.11.2016;I went there with my family to spend some time in the snow and have a lovely lunch. We were very disappointed. We were told we could only have a selfservice lunch. That there was nothing else they have on the menu that day (bussiest day-opening ski sesion). When we looked around we saw people eating all sorts of food that was not on the selfservice table. Anyway the kids were very hungry so we took a look on that table and saw some leftovers, uncooked rice, sauce with a lot of flour in it, soups with no noodles to put in the soup, no dessert etc. We asked if they could bring more fresh food several times and we were not the only one.The waiter was unfriendly wishing he'd be somewhere else, ignorant, we felt very redundant. We left the food, paid for the whole menu (only had a sip of that soup with uncooked rice). Please make an effort and don't shame such a great location with so much potential! And hire people who know what they are doing and loving it!;Hotel Bellevue;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelBellevue;Na Slemenu 35, Pohorje 2208, Slovenia;46.5157179;15.5789848
What a disgrace!;1;13.11.2016;Our family with two children went here for a lunch.It was the ski season opening day, so the restaurant was quite busy and obviously totally unprepared.It seemed the staff tried to sell the buffet lunch at all cost. They said they were out of deer goulash, but admitted they still have some after being asked to check with the kitchen. We insisted on this as we have previously received a different information from another staff member.My daughter chose to have the buffet lunch. The selection was poor, the food quality and taste were below all acceptable standards. The food was replenished only when the staff were prompted to do so (and ignored some of the requests). The service war terrible. Unfortunately, a total disgrace for the Slovenian tourism.;Hotel Bellevue;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelBellevue;Na Slemenu 35, Pohorje 2208, Slovenia;46.5157179;15.5789848

Rejected;1;14.06.2016;We came from a mountainbike tour around 8 p.m., due to the rain it was already getting dark. We asked for a room and were told that the hotel was fully booked. However the receptionist recommended another hotel and even phoned to make the recervation for us. We were wondering whether it was really fully booked - neither around the reception nor in the bar there was anyone to be seen - or if they didn't want to check us in because we looked not elegant enough. Later on we became curious and checked an online booking platform, apparently the Bellevue still had rooms available. So the receptionist had been helpful to us but this policy of rejecting potential guests by appearance is just disappointing and inacceptable.;Hotel Bellevue;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelBellevue;Na Slemenu 35, Pohorje 2208, Slovenia;46.5157179;15.5789848

Hotel has free Wi-Fi, but signal is so bad that you can't use it.The only problem in this hotel is food.Food is not tasty, they are preparing it without any imagination. It is pre-cooked and put into a big vessel, just like in a student canteen. No diversity, no fresh food, they are using only frozen food. That is not how it should be in a 4 star hotel.But this is a really cheap hotel, so you can't get everything.Really close to hotel is market, wher you can by basic things with fair prices.Ski school is really close, gondola too, and ski bus that takes you to another ski place Areh is also really close.

Unless you have your own food don't come close.;3;25.12.2013;The hotel is nicely situated, rooms are spacious and nice and clean. Most of the staff is very pleasant and helpfull. Its on top of the hill and if there would be snow you can have a great time here. There is only artificial snow and the skiing is terrible but you can not blame the hotel for this.The food breakfast and dinner is not eatable. I can not imagine how you can ruin a nice stay with terrible food. There is a buffet for breakfast and dinner they don't make fresh eggs. The breakfast is presented with the cheapest foods on the market and I would be ashamed to present that. Dinner is far worse, the cook should be fired and they should buy normal ingredients and get a normal cook to make a somehow eatable dinner. Dont go for food here. You can get a appartment where no food in included.

Great potential but services improvements are needed;3;8.09.2013;Hotel has a great location above Maribor city, in the Pohorje mountain. The suite we stayed two nights was clean and spacious. The price for suite was really reasonable. The negative of the hotel is limited parking lot. We had to park our car partly on the access road and partly on the side walk. Staff of the hotel was friendly, but with limited language skills. Unfortunately it was most obvious in restaurant. During the first evening however the waitresses have not been able to serve a food for us (especially for my daughter with a special diet and my wife with gluten free diet), thus we hade some leftovers from dinner bufet (my wife and daughter only plain rice with vegetables). After this not very positive experience we rather took a supper in Maribor city on the other day in order to avoid another dissapointment.Hotel has, mainly due to its location a great potential, but in comparison with other four star hotels there is a lot of deficiences, mainly in sector of services.;Hotel Bellevue;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelBellevue;Na Slemenu 35, Pohorje 2208, Slovenia;46.5157179;15.5789848

Nice hotel in the mountains;4;13.04.2013;My family and I stayed at this hotel for one night, on our way to Budapest. The staff is very friendly and the facilities are good. One needs to take a Gondola ride to get to the hotel, and the ride is very nice with a beautiful view. This hotel would be excellent for skiers. The breakfast was typically European, with a choice ot eggs cooked to order. It has some very nice health foods.The shorcomings are that the room does not have tea/coffee making facilities, and walking to the hotel is difficult with heavy baggage in snowy weather.;Hotel Bellevue;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelBellevue;Na Slemenu 35, Pohorje 2208, Slovenia;46.5157179;15.5789848
Perfect stay;5;17.03.2013;We have been there from 04 to 10. March in the end of the ski season . This hotel is excellent choice for this kind of tourism . Very clean hotel with sufficient large rooms for 4 star hotels . Choice of food is quite good , and personal very friendly . From ski depo you can go on Ski slopes directly .

Skiing convenience, excellent service;5;25.02.2013;Just returned from 6 day ski trip staying in 5 person apartment. In 20 years of skiing this was (apart from one trip in the States) easily the most spacious ski apartment we have stayed in and one of the most convenient for the slopes.The apartment was very clean, had everything we needed and facilites in the hotel were really good (wonderful heated lockers for the skis with access straight onto the slopes and wellness spa with different saunas and showers - only thing lacking was it would have been lovely to have had a jacuzzi - there was a whirlpool bath but only available if paying for one of the special treatments). We mostly self catered but ate in the restaurant a couple of times which had a fixed price (12 Euro) meal, buffet style. I felt the food was excellent value for money, considering the location. The starters and desserts very good and main courses acceptable for large scale buffet dining of this type.The staff were, without exception, helpful, friendly and professional. From dealing promptly with our initial email enquiries, to arranging for a taxi transfer from a local train station, and sorting out a problem with a lift pass booking, they could not have provided any better service. My only hesitation in recommending this hotel for a ski break is that I would rather it not become too popular!! I am sure we will be back.;Hotel Bellevue;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelBellevue;Na Slemenu 35, Pohorje 2208, Slovenia;46.5157179;15.5789848

Everything was very good except food;4;2.02.2013;The hotel is on the perfect location for skiing. Everything is very close (from hotel ski depo directly on slopes), baby lift was also very close what was perfect for us (family with two small kids). Rooms are quite big comparing to standard size for ****hotel. Hotel stuff was very friendly, helpful and professional.

actually quite ok, but could be better for 4*;3;24.01.2013;we stayed for a few days at the beginning of the ski season 2012-2013. I was before in the area and stayed at another hotel nearby, so I naturally compare the places - and the other one was better. In Bellevue rooms are big and nice, but some things are a bit dated. The bed is excellent though. one of our rooms had a funny smell that didn't go away. this hotel has no pool, but it does have an excellent spa area with alot of saunas - this is a great plus, but the lack of a pool is not so great. they can give you free entry to another spa, however, but this is in Maribor (25km & 40min away by car). the breakfast was excellent in the first days, but during the week when there were few guests it was not so nice anymore, you would need to ask for everything and they bring you what they remember. Not really 4* class. Nice and friendly staff!;Hotel Bellevue;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelBellevue;Na Slemenu 35, Pohorje 2208, Slovenia;46.5157179;15.5789848

Nice mountain hotel;4;19.10.2012;"We’ve been in the Bellevue Pohorje for two nights in May. We first booked only one night because we just wanted a bed after our visit in Maribor. But we liked here so much so we booked another night immediately. The hotel has everything you need to feel very comfortable: clean and spacy rooms, very good breakfast (although in low season is served only a smaller buffet, but it was enough), nice Spa and very nice and helpful employees. It is located in the mountains of Pohorje so it is a perfect place if you want go skiing in winter or walking in summer (there are many km beautiful walking tracks) what we did.The only problem is that it can be that you will have some problems to find this hotel because the navigation wants to use the ski run ;-) if you are there: don’t despair, there is also a normal road to the hotel ;-)As I said it is a very nice hotel but it isn’t the right location if you just want to visit Maribor.";Hotel Bellevue;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelBellevue;Na Slemenu 35, Pohorje 2208, Slovenia;46.5157179;15.5789848
It's perfect also in law season;4;17.09.2012;We have been in Easter Time. It wasn't the winter time for skiing and summer time for walking and we went there only for visiting Maribor. Even if it takes 20 minutes to arrive to Maribor by car this can be an excellent choice because the Hotel it’s prefect for relaxing when you came back or during the day. The service at the reception is very good, the room are big, comfortable and clean, the saunas are good and the restaurant is good too.

Good hotel in nice setting;4;25.08.2012;Good hotel. Large, clean rooms and reasonable meals - dinner and breakfast.

Good starting point for wonderful summer hikes;4;5.08.2012;Hotel, position, rooms - these all are very good going towards excellent. You can see that building is just few years old. Rooms are spacious, comfortable and clean. Staf very kind. There's a lot of activities you can do in the summer starting from hotel. If you have an option take a package with Hotel Habakuk spa&wellness include. Though is a little bit far (30 minutes drive into the valley) it's worth visiting. For that reason I gave high mark to the swimming pool and spa (there's nothing of this in hotel itself).I stayed pretty unsure about the food - although breakfasts are decent with some very healthy options, during two evening meals I really don't know what to think - first day excellent mushroom soup from fresh mushrooms picked from surrounding woods, also excellent homemade Pohorje stew, second day realy bad. Hard to say which of the extremes is more often but I'll say it's average on lopng term.What it realy disturbed me was service during meals - while staff was almost runing from kitchen to bar and tables (compliments for waitresses !) on the other hand things were not removed from table, waiting for ordering was a bit too long and you got a feeling there's some pepole missing to help.And for hotel manager: Please, the kind of music on the terrace is neither slovenian nor local it's something like 'B production Dalmatia meets Oberkrainer'. I really think that food would taste better if you just changed this few CDs.Maybe I'm a little bit hard on this but at the end is my city, my country and I really wish that this part of our beautiful country is offering best it can.;Hotel Bellevue;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelBellevue;Na Slemenu 35, Pohorje 2208, Slovenia;46.5157179;15.5789848

Perfect location;4;23.02.2012;"The location is the best in Mariborsko Pohorje as you exit the hotel and right on the ski slopes. The hotel even has nice boxes for the equipment which is handy. We had the 71m2 apartment which was really specious and fresh. The problem was that they didn't want to change the towels for us even though we booked it for 7 nights, so after a bit of arguments they started doing it from the second day, but the linnen were never touched...and they never cleaned the apartment except for emptying the garbage can. So basically it's a \do it all yourself\"" story which is fine if they told us so in advance which they didn't. The food is also avarage at best, but otherwise the hotel is good wich nice sauna facilities as well.""";Hotel Bellevue;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelBellevue;Na Slemenu 35, Pohorje 2208, Slovenia;46.5157179;15.5789848
Ski resort, great value in summer;5;9.02.2012;Great hotel on the mountain. I was there in summer as transfer hotel. I have two rooms connected by big living room with fully equipped kitchen. Accommodation for two families 2+2 was more than good. I regret that I cannot spent more time there as surrounding is beautiful. For sure it is ski hotel as you can ski form the hotel door down but thanks to this price in summers was attractive. Only problem is to get to hotel as from highway it is 50 min drive across mountain and navigation is misleading you remember to watch signposts.;Hotel Bellevue;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelBellevue;Na Slemenu 35, Pohorje 2208, Slovenia;46.5157179;15.5789848

All the staff members were extremely obliging and helpful.It was a great value for money as well; and our daily trips by funicular to the spa-wellness centre at Habakuk Hotel turned our stay in a truly exciting adventure for my daughter.

Great experience;5;25.07.2011;This hotel is probably the best 4* hotel in Slovenia. Superb service, room, view, spa, saunas, food! in our opinion Bellevue is overall better hotel then 5* Habakuk.Room is spacious, with nice interior design and quality of sleep is perfect one. Hotel look like completely new and is very good blend with nature - hidden gem. Hotel manager took us on a walk to the hill, introducing us with a locale cuisine, history and anecdotes. He offered us some home made borovnicek when we are looking from the hills down to Maribor.

nice hotel, lovely setting;4;6.01.2009;we stayed at the Bellevue for three nights in December 2008. the location is great: in the mountains overlooking Maribor. great base for hiking, skiing and mountaineering. We did not ski, but the lifts start right at the hotel so you just have to put your skis on and go off! Rooms are quite big and nice. We booked a wellness package that included half board and a massage. When we arrived, the hotel was fully booked and while the dining room had a bit of a youth hostel feel to it (simple design and lots of people just coming back from skiing, quite noisy as many families with kids were there), the choice of food was great. Unfortunately, during the next couple of days, as the hotel was quite empty, the dinner buffet suffered as well and was not very nice anymore. The spa centre is well designed and a pleasure to visit with different saunas and steam rooms. Unfortunately the 'surprise shower' (60 different types of showers in one) did not work when we were there. Our massage was only average. The gym room was a disappointment with only three machines and two of them not working. Maribor is also worth a visit: you can take the cable car to town. Overall a very nice hotel in a lovely setting and good value for money.;Hotel Bellevue;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelBellevue;Na Slemenu 35, Pohorje 2208, Slovenia;46.5157179;15.5789848
Bellevue exceeded our wildest expections!;5;12.11.2007;>>General<<I never thought one could stay in such wonderful surroundings, experience such excellent service in world class facilities - for the price we paid.We highly recommend the Bellevue, and will definitely return at every opportunity.>>Booking and Admin<<The Bellevue Hotel impressed us before we even set off, with their prompt and friendly communication. Our endless questions and queries were answered almost instantly by email, by very competent staff.>>Location<<Next (although this is obviously not to their credit) approaching the hotel is magical: if you're on foot, a romantic 10min trip up the cable car takes you to the summit of the Pohorje, where the hotel is nestled in amongst the soaring pine trees. The views are magnificent - what a way to start your holiday!Arriving by road is even more spectacular! It took us over an hour to do 3 miles, because we simply had to stop to take in the breathtaking views at every corner. Glowing forests, billowing mists, mountain cottages - a postcard scene!>>Reception<<On our arrival - the hotel impressed with loads of parking, and a very bright, competent, (good looking) : ) gentleman at reception, who had us off to our room in less than 5 min. The reception area is glossy, warm and welcoming.>>Room<<Our room was fabulous: Big, fluffy, crisp pillows, fluffy duvets and loooads of extra bedding in the wardrobe. Towels were divine: fluffy, thick and luxuriously embroidered. The bathroom was gleaming and squeaky clean (and has a separate toilet, yay!). Huge floor to ceiling windows open onto the fir forests - and the efficient air con, ensures you are toasty and warm, whatever the weather. Ofcourse, all the other freebies are there, cable TV, soaps, shampoo etc.)>>Food<<We enjoyed two dinners and two breakfasts and we were blown away by the food. The buffet offered a selection of at least 3 - 4 meat dishes - introducing delicious local foods which we couldn't get enough of. Hot breakfast (or cold if you want), including local speciality sausages which I highly recommend!>>Facilities<<WOW! Its worth just visiting Bellevue for the spa alone! The SAUNAS are world class - I have been to several other spa's and this is defeintely one of the better ones! The staff is competent, friendly and enthusiastic. (a far cry from the UK!). And the prices for treatments are INCREDIBLY good value for money!

Sport-onriendted hotel outside Maribor;4;28.05.2017;LOCATION: Located outside the centre, and only reachable by car. If you are travelling by public transportm this is not a good choice. By car, it's 5 to 10 minutes away from the (small) centre of Maribor. The hotel has an indoor parking that costs a very affordable 5 EUR (you can drive in and out as you wish for that price).PREMISES: distinctive late 80s look with a few more recent elements, overall modern. Due to its size, not a good choice if you are looking intimate athmosphere, but very efficient and probably ideal if you want to go skiing in the adjoining ski resort. Caters a lot for groups, so expect a crowd, especially for breakfast.The hotel features an inside and an outside pool. Water of the inside pool was rather warm (a bit too much even), and look was of a pool that had seen better days. It is clearly more tailored for families and leisure, because you can't swim in a straight line due to all the curves and compartiments in the pool.Wifi was free and fast, working well in all parts of the hotel.ROOM: Extremely spacious and very comfortable, with a large bathroom though small shower.RESTAURANT: the buffet breakfast buffet was OK, not a huge choice but enough to fill your stomach and to cater for different tastes.STAFF: friendly and helpful;Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999
Stay at Habakkuk ;3;19.05.2017;Hotel Habakkuk is a calm hotel I would say in the city suburb. Based at the base of a mountain. If you want to visit Maribor and you want to stay out the city center then the hotel could be the place you want. The inconvenience I would mention is that there are no Restaurants in its surrounding, still you can find but limited choices. On the contrary, you have enough space to walk in the nature, green spaces and a fresh air to breath. The staff is welcoming and the hotel is calm.;Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999

Nice location;3;3.03.2017;Habakuk would be yet another typical socialist hotel with large entrance, big reception area, huge restaurant, and swimming pools that were obviously designed late seventies and early eighties if it wasn't for an excellent and very helpful receptionists, modern rooms, and wonderful surroundings.The restaurant and the bar are not something that would qualify as not to be missed.

Olden elegance;4;26.02.2017;The Habakuk is perfectly located for both the thrill seeking and laid back traveler. My wife and I visited the Hotel during September so we where blessed with perfect weather. Entering the hotel you are overwhelmed by the old elegance. Staff at reception was friendly and very helpful. Traveling through Europe you kind of get used to small rooms... our room at Habakuk was absolutely massive (I was dancing in circles with my arms stretched out and even after loosing my balance I didn't touch anything), with a nice balcony overlooking the pool on the side of the hotel, giving you breathtaking views of Maribor and the surrounding landscapes. The breakfasts and dinners are everything and more than what we expected. The Spa is a must do activity sitting in the hot pool is very relaxing. The hotel has a shuttle from Zagreb which was very convenient. There is also a bus stop right across the hotel the can take you into the old town of Maribor. The cable way is another must do, with breathtaking views all round, I remember my wife saying that no amount of googling can prepare you for the beauty of the place. The Hotel has the elegance of a time passed, but its still very well looked after and run very efficiently and up to modern standards.;Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999

A very good hotel but .....;4;24.11.2016;I visited this hotel on a rainy Autumn weekend so didn't see it at its best. Nevertheless I was very happy with the experience. The hotel is in a pleasant location just outside Maribor with lovely views from every angle. We were fortunate to have a nice room overlooking the hills in, what I would guess, is the newer part of the hotel. The room was clean, spacious (with a sitting area with couch and armchairs) and as we were with a family, we opened the connecting door between our rooms. The bathroom was large with a shower cabinet and very clean. Maybe there could have been a cupboard here for those who stay a little longer.There is a large underground garage which leads directly to reception. I must mention that the reception process was extremely efficient as was the check out. We also enjoyed the pool area. This contained one of the best indoor spa pools I have been in. The water was very warm and there were plenty of bubbles and massage jets at varying heights. There is only a small outdoor pool in winter though this is accessed via a short covered walkway and the outside pool area looked very pleasant and extensive. There is a small area where one can obtain various drinks but be warned, don't wait for service, ring the bell on the wall and you will be seen to immediately. There is a wellness centre where we had massages and facials. Both the women who we saw seemed to know what they were doing which is not always the case and the prices were reasonable for a hotel.There is a good lounge and bar area just outside the restaurant, so much nicer than the usual lounge by reception and all the staff throughout were helpful and friendly.So now we come to the 'but' and unfortunately it is the food. There was nothing actually wrong with it but it was all very average, maybe less than average for a four star hotel. Dull, plain, unimaginative are just some of the adjectives I would use and for this reason I have not given the hotel an excellent rating. As it was self service you don't go hungry but when I visit again, which I intend to do, I will stay bed and breakfast.;Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999
A little disappointing;3;31.10.2016;Stayed for 6 nights on business. Overall this hotel is a bit worn down the upside is pool and spa areas.This hotel has a newer part which was noticeably more nice. As I stayed in old part:Beds are old and not very good.Shower is not good - lacks power.WiFi was really bad except in reception area.Even tough my room was non smoking it had a smokey smell.Overall would not recommend.;Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999
Conference ;5;30.10.2016;Stayed at Hotel Arena But had a conference at this hotel - very well organised and accommodating throughout the three day. The rooms are spacious and the finding space is a delight to sit in - they can accommodate for 100's of people. They have a lift if needed and can accommodate dietary requirements just a tad limited in choice;Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999

Very nice hotel!;4;10.10.2016;We were in this hotel for one night only. All I can say was good. Nice position of the hotel. Immediately under the Pohorje mountain and lifts. Food, wine, cofee, rooms, pool, staff..The only issue we had was a dinner (wine bill) but the waiter solved it luckly!;Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999
tiem ago maybe was a great hotel;2;19.09.2016;The hotel is very big but without investment. Everything looks very old. We were in a renovated rooms and they are really nice but everything else was old. The food was ok, not a lot to choose but good.;Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999
Large decrepit hotel with very friendly staff;2;14.09.2016;We booked the room a few weeks in advance with the expectation to relax a bit in a wellness hotel. When we arrived, the person at the front desk was very nice and friendly, the same applies for all other employees that we met.Nevertheless we shortened our stay, because we were not able to enjoy a single moment as everything looks very old and worn down. In my opinion the whole hotel needs an extensive renovation - it looks like it lost its charm already 20 years ago. We were quite disappointed since it is not so cheap and we had imagined it very differently. Regarding the food, the breakfast was okay, but not great. The coffee tasted horrible. We did not try dinner after all.I feel a bit sorry to give such a bad review, as the employees really do everything in order to guarantee a pleasant stay. But no matter how hard they try, the state of the facilities ruined our stay completely and we were happy as soon as we could checkout.;Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999
Really nice stay with realy tasty food;5;13.09.2016;Stayed 2nd time in Habakuk and really like it. The nature is beautiful, food is delicious, staff is super friendly. Rooms are clean and modern. The only thig that is not so good is the pool which should be renovated. Saunas are nice, but don't like the attitude of visitors - walking in swimsuits, talking laud, loughing.Will still rate it 5 stars because both time we visited it was a nice stay.;Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999

Huge room;5;23.08.2016;Fantastic room bathroom very big. Downside is that the shower is in the bathtub The issue is that the tub is really high and hard to get in for small people or people with leg problems. A lot of good beachbeds at the pool. Although a lot of different food in buffetform. Not always very tasty. Hotel at the foot of a hill. Cablecar to the top. Not really nice walks. Half hour drive to Ptuj is really nice. To the east go to the small place Jeruzalem. A lot of vineyards. Beautiful.

Very good hotel with nice pool;4;8.08.2016;We stayed here with our 3 kids. The rooms are clean and complete and ours had a balcony with mountainbike view. Breakfast is a big plus, especially the lady preparing your eggs how you like them. There is a welness center in the hotel with free saunas and very nice swimming pools indoor and outside.

Oldie but goodie;4;17.07.2016;We had a 3 night stay at the hotel, which was very nice. The general area whilst a small visitor attraction is very pretty set amongst the local mountains, and has a just a couple of local bars and restaurants which are simple, good and cheap. The hotel itself is nicely appointed but it is definitely showing signs of wear and tear as a result of its age. The pool for instance, whilst a very pleasant clean space with nice Jacuzzis etc is really in need of a bit of an overhaul/re-tiling. The restaurant and rest of the hotel has a very definite 70's feel which all needs freshening up. Because of the local bars and restaurants, and the dated appearance of the hotel we didn't bother eating in the hotel at all apart from breakfast as it was included. Our room, on the other hand had clearly been renovated to a very nice modern standard, which was a shame as it might have been a nice to eat in and sit in the hotel bar for the evening. In contrast, our room was very comfortable, clean and nicely appointed with good TV/wi-fi mini bar and tea and coffee. During our stay we used treated ourselves to a massage in the Spa which was really nice and quite reasonable priced. Again all a bit dated, but good quality and very professional. I think in hindsight, if I was particularly looking for a hotel in this area I would stay here again, but more likely, as there are so many other cheap self catering options, I might be more likely to keep a few Euros in my wallet and look elsewhere.;Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999
Good hotel but it could even be better with some love.;4;9.07.2016;A very nice hotel with excellent rooms (probably renovated not long ago), the hotel looks like it was a 5* hotel but it seems it lost its potential a while ago. Staff is friendly and speak their languages. Food variety is huge and of great taste.Swimming pools needs an renovation but are nice to swim in. Spa facility's are okay but only 4 sauna's and probably when the hotel is full are a bit to small.Someone should invest in this hotel and make it work again.;Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999
Could be a great hotel, but it's not;3;19.06.2016;This hotel has an amazing potential to be exceptional. For now it caters sports people. Rooms are enormous! But they are sooo old! Curtains match the beds. It is so old it is crying for help. Water bed is also not a great thing. With those room sizes this hotel could be a ten star hotel if it was stripped out and renovated.They have a huge pool area inside and out. The atmosphere is relaxing and location is nice and quite.However the hotel is tired , their staff is tired. No one is smiling. I believe Habakuk could be one of the best hotels in the region if it were renovated.

Missing some renovation;3;29.02.2016;Spent two days at this hotel. Does not deserve a high rank marks, because of its state. Worn out and kind of neglected.

A quality hotel with a wellness centre.;4;28.02.2016;I stayed in a superior double room which had fast, reliable wi-fi and was very comfortable. I enjoyed relaxing in the pool and sauna. The sauna is textile free. Be prepared for that as not everyone is comfortable with nudity in a mixed environment. If you are it's a great place to unwind after winter sport or walking.The location is great for walking on the Pohorje Mountains.The number 6 bus stops at the ski lift, 100 metres from the hotel, and the journey into town takes around 15 minutes. In February 2016 a single ticket cost €1.10. Alternatively ask in the lobby for a taxi into town. I also did this and it takes 10 minutes, costing around €10.The Habakuk is a fine base for exploring Maribor and its hinterland.;Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999

The rooms are renovated and with a spacious bathrooms. Breakfast and dinner should be on a higher quality, but I would like to add that we were guests during November so I am sure that in high season the offer is quite different. The restaurant staff is definitely putting more effort by interacting with guests. The indoor pool is very nice, with perfect temperature. An ideal getaway for a weekend with kids.

Very nice hotel.;5;14.11.2015;We stayed in a new room. Everything was new, clean and comfortable. The only thing that we needed in the room was a few towel racks or hooks for our damp bathrobes. Some would maybe say that the room is not too spacious, but we spent most of our time at the spa and outside, so this is not something that really bothered us.The breakfast and dinner were excellent! Lots and lots of choices as well as an organic section (soy, rice milk, organic fruit and cereal)! There was also espresso/cappuccinos available at breakfast! Huge +The indoor pool is great.

This would be a great four star hotel;4;4.10.2015;General impressions of the hotel are very good and we had a great vacation, but it does not completely meet the requirements of 5 star hotel. Best things definitely are free: garage, WI-FI (excellent signal everywhere), sauna and swimming pool area. Friendly staff, big clean room and bathroom with a large selection of complementary cosmetics, varied breakfast, beautifully decorated dining area with a piano player who creates a pleasant atmosphere. One of the great things that breakfast is till 11.00 and dinner till 22.00 h..Least good is definitely the indoor pool area which in eighties certainly looked great, but it's at least outdated and needs refurbishing. Buffet dinner is certainly not five stars quality.;Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999

OK, it is not touching like a 5* feeling - but I recognized no weaks;4;9.09.2015;My room in second floor was absolutely a very stylish one: LED´s lights on the via-a-vis wall from bed (which were very comfortable), a modern Flat-Screen, very compact bathroom (with shower only), free conditioner, shampoo and bod lotion, hairdryer. Had view on the side to the forest, so totally silence - modern aircondition working with low noise-level. Joined the bar late, they offered good sandwich (toast) and beer for an acceptable price-level. Very spacious garage for parking safetly car. As a summary: a very relaxed stay for one night.

An old stylish hotel;4;6.05.2015;"The hotel has very good location, close to the ski gondola, and its own garage for guests. Interior is old fashioned, with traces of old glory. You can see it was a stylish hotel, and they are doing their best to keep the old quality. Especially the staff is excellent, always smiling and helpful. Our room was superior, large enough and renovated, but cold (corner room). When we complained, they sent us a technician who checked heating, found everything ok and said we had to accommodate to this temperature. Bathroom was well equipped, but no heating at all; we were freezing every time after taking shower. Also, there was no drying holder for the towels, meaning that you have no place to dry your towels and bathrobes after using a spa. Mistake of a architect!! Breakfast and dinner very good, and big choice of cakes. we found them very delicious. Spa good enough, but a little dated (need at least a good cleaning). They allow people from outside to enter the spa, which makes crowed, especially with children. Also, the best chairs in spa area were reserved all the time we were there, because the general manager had some guests from Russia. That means that every day you couldn´t use the best chairs, although they stayed empty all the day, because \if somebody of his guest wants to...\"" The same thing was in the restaurant: one big part was reserved \""for the manager´s guests\"", and also the place in garage. I think this is some kind of discrimination of the guest - if we pay to use the whole hotel, we have the right to use it; but it was forbidden for all other guests except his!""";Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999
Good located average hotel;4;4.05.2015;My boyfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights, in a junior suite.Location: good, at the foot of the Pohorje Hills, close to the ski lifts (there is another hotel on top of the hill!), nice view from the room. City center is approx. 10 minutes by car. Taxi costs around 8 Eur/way.Hotel itself: outside: some reparation and renovation necessary. Inside it is quite boring, usual 4star hotel standard, clean and tries to be goodlooking :-) Wellness area: there were large (empty) pools outside, and one, big pool (containing some smaller pools) inside. If the hotel is not full, it is quite pleasant to stay. They let in also non-hotel guests. One morning the fresh towels didn't arrive in time.Room: spacious, renovated, nice furnishing, good lights, except my reading light, which didn't work and they didn't manage to fix it in 2 days. Nice, spacious bathroom, but water pressure was never strong enough for a good shower :(((( Huge, comfy bed!!!! Terrace was interesting, as we were on the 1st floor, our terrace was a small part of the roof of the wellness area. Other guests could walk in front of our room if they wanted. Anyway, they didn't, while I could enjoy the whole roof to myself (mainly the panorama). Breakfast: various impressions. First morning everything was fresh and of high quality, while on the 2nd (with a bigger number of guests), quality got lower (eg. canned pineapple instead of fresh, smaller variety of pastries, cafe machine gone). Fortunately, cafe machine and fresh pineapple came back to the 3rd morning :-) We didn't try to have dinner at the hotel.Staff: friendly, always smiling.Whether I would return: I do not think so, maybe my boyfriend would, for a shor ski holiday :-). It is nothing special, and Maribor doesn't have so many things to offer. Instead, I would rather go to lake Bled and Bohinj :-);Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999
Nice hotel, but not really 5*...;4;27.04.2015;The hotel is generally nice, rooms are nice, bathrooms are OK, although shower cabins are quite small, food is OK, location is very good (if you consider to have a car, off course, so that you can visit nearby city Maribor, which is very cute, or for example to go to beautiful city Graz in Austria, which is pretty nearby Slovenia/Maribor)...

An excellent choice for a ski weekend;4;25.03.2015;"My husband and I stayed at the Pohorje, at the hotel \Habakuk Annex\"" from 15 to 20 February 2015. The hotel is located about 200 m from the cable car. Beautifully decorated, there is plenty to do. It is suitable for skiers but also for business meetings. If you are coming to ski in the hotel you can get ski info. But you can get a discount on the price of ski tickets if you pay at the hotel.The rooms are very comfortable and clean. The bathroom is spacious but the shower is small, so the bigger people have problems while taking showers. The food is varied, fresh and delicious. The staff is unobtrusive and service. The objection is that, in the dining room on the TV broadcast advertising video clips clinics for cosmetic surgery, which is located in the hotel. During breakfast watching the preparation for liposuction.Ski slopes are well maintained, but not visibly marked. No plan ski resort on the slopes. Lifts are quite old, very often stop. The long and meandering slope is is Èopova proga (linked to the cable car), if there is enough snow. At the top of the neighboring Areh are very nice, wide ski slopes. I would single out the track Partizanka, where due to the position always has more natural snow and not crowded. These two parts are linked ski area by bus, the ride takes about 20 minutes.The resort is near the city of Maribor. If you want, you can ski in morning and in the afternoon to tour the nearby places. The recommendation is very nice place Ptuj. Austria is very close, it is recommended Graz, about 60 km.""";Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999
Nice and comfortable;5;19.03.2015;I went to Habakuk with my family (husband and 6 years old son) for skiing. It is great option because gondola lift cable is just behind the hotel. It is comfortable, old fashionable back to ’80s but it is not crucial among all good things this hotel offers. Well, staff is very kind, rooms are spacious and clean, food is good, spa and swimming pool are correct. You wouldn't find some unpleasant suprise anywhere, everything fits to guests' demands. We are very satisfied, I highly recommend this hotel.;Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999
Overall a nice stay;4;7.03.2015;We've spent three days at this hotel with a group. The hotel is a bit old fashioned and not in a good way, not classic but it has rather a dated feel. I presume it's undergoing renovation so there are 2 types of rooms. Our group was accommodated partly in the old and partly in the new rooms. The old rooms are very spacious, with a walk in wardrobe, huge bathroom and huge room with a sitting area. It reminded me of hotel rooms in the States which I consider way too big at times. The old rooms also have dated furniture, bedding, curtains... As opposed to this the new rooms are very hip with shelves that have built in lights, tea- and coffee making facilities (the old rooms did not have this), nice bathroom, the fabrics used are also more modern, but these rooms are substantially smaller. The rooms were mostly clean with some smaller issues, the staff very kind and helpful, the food was also fine. We had a good time overall and on departure we asked for lunch packets. We not only got the vegetarian options we requested (clearly marked - this is still an issue at times), but we even got a special packet for one person who eats gluten free! We were very impressed by this.This was the first time for many in Slovenia and we were impressed by the kindness of people and how beautiful this country is.;Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999
Luxury ski and welness hotel;5;6.02.2015;We spent 5 nights here in January for skiing. The locker system to store skis and boots is very comfortable. The valley station of the ski-lift (a cabine-car) is 5 minutes walk far in ski-boots. The hotel has a large wellness center with a large indoor pool having numerous water massage facilities and several water temperature basins. The wellness center has more sauna rooms and a steam bath. A small,warm water open-air swimming pool with feet and back massage facilitites is open even in winter. I usually don't like wellness departments of hotels, but this is a really good one.The rooms and bathrooms are very spacious and well equipped. The restaurant is elegant. Breakfast and dinner are very rich. They offer food for special culinary habits for example vegetarian food, began products, bio-corner, fresh steaks, etc...The staff is very friendly, helpful, smiling. They can offer ski-trainer. The historical city-center is far from the hotel. Approach one bus or car.Good hotel.;Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999
Do not eat...;3;4.02.2015;at least the offered buffet for €20.Not only is the food taste wise an insult but also most of the time nearly empty so that you have to scratch the leftovers and also optically the presentation is a mess.The offered wine by glass was - considering the good wine of Slovenia - also not acceptable.Service was below average.I had a superior room which - judging the pics on the webpage- seem to be renewed.The room was comfortable and had access to a terrace.For sure the hotel do not deserve all the stars and not worth the money.I would not recommend to friends.;Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999
Inconsistent for a 5-star;4;17.12.2014;"InconsistentSpent 7 nights here in mid-December. The first impression when driving to the hotel and entering their complimentary garage was not the best. There were missing/broken cement tiles right above the drive-way to the main entrance, the garage looks somewhat neglected with water dripping from the floor above and forming cave-like formations! A walk around the property reveals mold is developing on several outside walls ... Far from a 5-star impression.The check-in by front desk clerk Saso was very friendly, polite and professional. The room keys and all the package information was ready for me.The hallways, elevators and stairways of the hotel were mostly also rather dated and could use a brush-up, some of the features and solutions are visibly out-dated and from another era.The room was a nice surprise, I guess it was the \superior\"" type. It was spacious, stylish, functional, in good shape and very clean. There was lots of room for everything and the amenities were more than sufficient. Same goes for bathroom - clean, spacious, stylish, lots of shelves and great bathroom amenities kit. Regarding the room there ard only two minor things - the room door was not soundproof at all and there were some nasty stains on the red carpet that could use a cleaning.The complimentary wireless internet worked fine and with adequate speeds.The housekeeping was great! They did their job thoroughly every day, replenishing all the complimentary coffee, tea, bathroom amenities. They provided lots of fresh towels daily. They cleaned the room spotlessly and they completed their job immediately after you hung \""service requested\"" on the door.Meals were nice, however breakfast was not so outstanding for a 5-star property, dinner was more in line with the star rating. The dinner staff were much better trained than breakfast attendents, who chatted loudly among themselves throughout the breakfast hall.The pool area was dated, but clean and nice, the saunas were a bit of a disappointment for me. The area was small, dated, with mold starting to develop in several areas. The life-guard/sauna attendents were not friendly, they were poorly trained. They didn't even say \""hi\"", when they performed the periodical sauna checks. No programme in the saunas either.Fitness room was another disappointment, even for a 3-star hotel. Lots of equipment was broken, the assortment of the equipment was very limited, some of the equipment was placed in a side hallway, some in the fitness room. On my first visit both water bars were empty.Beauty center / massage area was great, nice, clean and with very friendly and well trained staff.All in all - a renovation is badly needed in several areas of the hotel as well as better staff training.

A recommendation for Maribor;5;6.10.2014;The Habakuk Wellness Hotel is a large house.There is a free underground car park with very narrow parking spaces. The exit of the garage and the hotel access should be better signposted. Access to the reception desk through a mirrored corridor was a good idea of the architect.Quietly located on the outskirts of Maribor it takes about 10 to 15 minutes to drive to the city center.Reception at the front desk was very friendly and both check-in and check-out were carried out professionally.The breakfast buffet offered a big choice of food and very good quality.The hotel offers very large and well-kept thermal pools both inside and outside. There are plenty of sunbeds with comfortable mattresses. The water temperature was not too high so that swimming was possible, too.We were given a large and quiet room with all the amenities you would expect of a 5 star hotel.The free Wi-Fi in the room worked flawlessly and the data rate was high.The Habakuk in Maribor can definitely be recommended, especially if you want to combine sightseeing and wellness.;Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999
'Coach Trip' stopover;5;26.09.2014;Stayed at the Habakuk for two nights in September as part of tour on the television programme 'Coach Trip', and what a treat it was! Wonderful hotel, resort and convention centre. First class room, clean and thoughtfully furnished, our room was overlooking the swimming pool and heli-pad. Restaurant pleasant and with a choice to satisfy any palate. A little way to Maribor centre, taxi fare in the region of 15 euros, had a lovely time in the centre, lots of shopping opportunities, restaurants and the like. The hotel has a spa, indoor pool, wellness centre and lots more. I know we stayed there at the expense of a tv company but I would not hesitate to re-visit.

Perhaps a glistening shadow of its former self;4;25.09.2014;"I stayed here two nights for business in the area. The hotel is on the south western side of town, far and away from Maribor. It is not convenient to downtown , but it is a secluded retreat. The furnishings in the lobby and restaurants are reminiscent of French Provincial decor with lots of white, gold, and marble. The rooms are large and sleek with modern conveniences. The staff is very friendly, but not widely proficient in English; some German helps.

Very comfortable hotel, friendly stuff;5;22.08.2013;Hotel is conviniently located close to Maribor with local bus line for downtown stopping right in front of hotel. Next to hotel there is ski lift just next to hotel (operating in summer as well) that can take you to the top of Pohorje (1042 m altitude) within few minutes. It is also used by bikers that enjoy mountine bike special path which is really exciting. Hotel has been built in (I think) three phases so rooms are also in three formats. We stayed in superior room in the newest block and it was really spaceous with large bathroom, walk in closet, sitting area and nice balcony. Beds are comfortable and cleanness was really good.Every day we were getting complementary bottle of mineral water and fruit box.

Great hotel!;5;21.08.2013;I've been to this hotel several times. I've went on winter holiday (for skiing), summer holiday (for few days), business trips, and I have had pleasant stay each time. Habakuk has very convenient location, as it's located in foothill of Pohorje mountain (20 m from ski gondola) so it's very close to ski slopes. Also it's 10 min away (by car or bus) from Maribor town center.Accommodation is also very good, rooms are spacious enough and modern, with all necessary things. Food is also really good (I always take HB). Habakuk offer very good congress center, if you are on some business trip. Stuff is also great and very helpful. And best of all is Habakuk's SPA center. It has 2 big swimming pools with thermal water (indoor and outdoor) and one smaller outdoor in which you can swim during winter too, good gym.

Good hotel now - will be great in the future;4;25.04.2013;Stayed here on a brief business visit to the local hotel school. Location is of course gorgeous, looking over the hills and very close to the ski slopes. What particularly surprised me however was the contrast between the hotel interior and my room interior. If you stay here make sure to ask for one of the newly renovated rooms. They are smartly designed with many little nuances such as LED light illuminating the walls and tables and hidden bedside lamps. The beds are also extremely comfortable. See my photos for more details. The hotel currently has 52 of these rooms (I stayed in room 316 which was quite nice). Plans are to renovate all the rooms.

Great hotel with great service;5;20.04.2013;Visited the hotel for a conference and was gladly surprised by the high standard of the hotel and the service. The only downside found was that the air conditioning was not working, so we had to open to windows to cool the room. Some of the water facilities had not yet opened for the summer season so we couldn't try the outdoor pool facilities. The food was typical eastern European, very fat food with more emphasis on the quantity than the quality.

Luxury winter experience in Maribor;5;23.02.2013;I spent 5 nights in this hotel with my family. Very nice and comfortable hotel. Kind staff. Great spa with whirlpools, saunas, small fitness centre, beauty centre and squash. Experience to swim in the outdoor swimming pool surounded with snow was also great. Excellent food. Drinks were a bit overpriced, but this is a 5star hotel. Location is also OK, but be carefull if you are not skiing and have children attending the ski-school on the top of Pohorje mountain in the morning. If you go by car to the top you have about 25 km. The fastes option is ropeway but it cost 10 EUR (return ticket) per person (children under 6 are free) and you need about 15 minutes to the top. The location of the hotel is great for skiing for persons with valid ski-pass and no small children.;Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999
Pleasant experience;5;22.02.2013;We stayed as family with small kid for 5 days. Hotel is 50 m from ski sloops, so it's perfect if you are planning to ski. Spa and pool area is great, clean and spacious. Hotel staff was perfect, everybody was very polite with real smile on their face. Witch sometimes can mean a lot. Food was very good with lot of choices. Rooms are very spacious and only thing what we expected more or we didn’t like was rooms interior. But that was minor thing in all along experience.;Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999
Old meets new;4;20.01.2013;Very well situated hotel near ski slopes. Hotel has wonderfull spa and pool, and some newly renovated rooms. I stayed in older one which are more spaceous, but heating is noisy and couldn`t be regulated much. Food is excellent with plenty of fresh fruits and delicious dishes. My impresion is that hotel is popular for congress tourisms due to number of halls throughout hotel.Would recomend hotel for all types of guests.;Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999

Fantastic Resort Hotel with Tons of Positives;5;12.11.2012;We stayed at Hotel Habakuk for an extended stay of 11 nights in November 2012. The hotel is located close to the ski slopes in the outskirts of the Maribor, at a distance of about 6 miles to the center of the town. The views are gorgeous, the air clean and the staff very friendly. We had a room in the older section of the hotel which was very clean and nice with a large marble bathroom. The rooms in the newer section are even nicer with designer furnishings, but are slightly smaller (I prefer the room we have). Internet access is readily available everywhere in the hotel and the speeds are excellent, even at busy times. Our plan included three daily meals which were all very varied, plentiful and generally of good to excellent quality. I was particularly impressed with the large variety of pastry served at every meal. The hotel includes indoor and outdoor pools as well as a training room and a full spa. The indoor pool is the best I've seen anywhere.There really isn't any negative to this hotel. My mattress was a little uncomfortable. When I mentioned this to the front desk, they readily replaced it. Also, I find the shower stall a little too small for my taste, but the good water pressure makes up for it.All in all, this is a fantastic hotel with a lot of great features. If your purpose is to visit the town, the distance is a bit of a drawback, but good public transportation is readily available just outside the hotel.;Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999

Convenient & reliable!;4;24.10.2012;"We spent a week as family and I really enjoyed the hospitality and professional attitude. Overall, I'd recommend it's location next to ski lift and mountanious areas. The pool area needs significant uplift, whereas sauna section is really good. Staff is exceptionally polite and helpful. Food is generally ok, although sometimes lacks taste, especially for dinner. Finally, this hotel has this appearance from \good old days\"" and it can hardly be 5-star without substantial renovation. Next time I'd prefer Bellevue Hotel, as it really has mountain location. Habakuk is more like a city hotel...""";Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999
No.1 hotel in Maribor;5;16.10.2012;Hotel Habakuk is near by Pohorje skiing resort (very good location if you plan to go skiing there) and it's a little bit out of the town of Maribor. I am sure that it is the best place to stay in Maribor, it has very, very nice good looking and big rooms and the service and food is also excellent.

Slovenian Get-away;5;1.10.2012;During a recent holiday to Hungary, we decided to take a mini road-trip. Maribor in Slovenia was our second stop. The hotel Habakuk on the outskirts of the city is a little gem. Indoor and outdoor swimming pools, saunas, excellent room service, multi-lingual staff, fantastic food. Brilliant!Plenty of car-parking on site and access to the ski-lift and cable car literally just out the back door of the hotel. Main parts of the hotel look a little old and 1970's style but the new-build rooms are very up to date. Huge bathrooms but no bath - only showers!Value for money and a great place to stay in the summer. Only about 3 hours drive from Budapest or 1.5 hours from Zagreb.;Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999

Little hidden gem;5;6.03.2012;On our way to Italy, we were running late and decided to stop somewhere and complete our trip the next day. We stayed at Hotel Habakuk in Mirabor, Slovenia, a ski resort and hidden gem. The hotel is lovely, the service is impeccible, and the food was delicious. Our room was a very large king room, with all the luxuries of a 5 star hotel, but with European elegance. We could have easily stayed 2 or 3 nights, just to enjoy the hotel and surroundings.;Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999

Great hotel, great location...;5;11.11.2011;Our third visit here and still impressed! Especially now with renovations of some rooms which are now rated as 5 or 4 star rooms ( renovated rooms are rated 5 star ). These rooms are really nice, big and modern - contemporary - looking! We were on 3rd floor and had a nice view from the balcony of surrounding hills and outskirts of Maribor city. Bed and bed linen were wonderful, we had a wonderful sleep. Room service was great, room was serviced by the time we came back from breakfast. Buffet breakfast was also great, good selection and good quality with great service. Dinners, which were included in our rate, were not as good. If there are 10 people or less at the hotel, you can choose meal from A-la-carte menu. If enough guests, it would be a buffet style. When we had A-la-carte, the food was nice, fresh and hot, but it was different story with buffets. If you didn't come at 7pm, when the dinner starts, hot food would be only warm or sometimes even cold already. We thought A-la-carte food was better quality then buffet style food. We expected better quality of food for a 5 star hotel, especially when we had buffet dinner. Buffet dinner costs 19 Euros per person if it's not included in your room rate. Needs improvement! Pool looked nice from the distance, we didn't use it so we can't judge. We heard from other guests that massage and fitness center was really nice and that they enjoyed it. Position of the hotel is excellent, at the bottom of Pohorje hill and next to the forest so you can enjoy lovely walks around the area. There are few restaurants close by and it's worth to mention La Cantina Pizzerija only a minute walk from the hotel. It's a lovely restaurant, known by wood fired pizzas of all sorts (very yummy), pasta dishes, cold meat platters and so on. Very tasty food and inexpensive, very good value for money. Parking is complimentary ( in the garage ) for hotel guests and concierge is always ready to assist and help. Staff in general is very friendly, helpful and willing to accommodate your expectations.;Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999
It was a nice hotel ten years ago, now it is awful;2;23.10.2011;Ten years ago this was a nice big new hotel with great spa, pools, saunas, rooms, and restaurants.Now it is just awful. Nothing was renovated. Moreover, it is dirty. In the pool and around the pools you can see alges and dirt everywhere. We told that to the management and they said they were saving money.Food outside at the grill was discusting. The students working there were nice. We ordered calamari and we got them uncooked on the table. When we showed it to a cook he appologized and said that he apologizes cause the manager got some disgusting fake calamari ehich cannot be cooked and nobody wants to eat them. He offered to make a hamburger for us for free. This is a five star hotel?;Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999
If you like a concrete, dark cube as 5 stars hotel...;3;16.10.2011;Place at the foot of the Pohorje mountain (Golden fox ski race) and 5 min from the center of Maribor, it is one of the most luxurious hotels in Slovenia. Pool, massage, sport center, room service, all you can expect from a 5 star hotel is provided. However, just a glimpse at the reception hall is disappointing: dark, old fashioned (not in a nice way). Plus, from outside, this looks like a communistic ugly grey concrete cube. Finally, the doormen are less than average for politeness, service and efficiency. You'll pay a lot for a kind of bitter taste.;Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999
friendly staff all around, professional management;4;6.06.2011;It was only during a third visit to Maribor I discovered the existence of Habakuk. A fantastic extra to beautiful Maribor and near surroundings. The swimming pool has to be seen - and used - to be believed. The cost of entry for non residents is € 17 for 4 hours. If you so wish it includes sauna use. Kind Mr Saso Brecelj in reception advised the hotel welcomes non guests at the rate mentioned.

Surroundings are peacefull and nature is so beautifull. We were really satisfied with our room, it had everything we needed. Staff was very friendly and great. Choice of food was very good we even had a glass of champagne for breakfast :-)Beauty center offered good service and they mostly use \Babor\"" cosmetics.Gondola for the top of the mountain is just few meters from hotel entrance.

Ok for a pitstop;3;30.08.2009;Hotel is just outside Maribor which is not the most picturesque city I've been too. We were en-route from Croatia to Czech Republic so it was ideal for a short pitstop.

Nice rest;4;20.09.2008;My wife and I booked a wellness weekend in hotel Habakuk. The hotel is pretty old but we were in a renovated or new part. The room was very comfortable, the staff was helpfull - with some exceptions. We got a free ticket for the cable car and went to the hotel on the top - Bellevue. We could go to the spa center there and we went to the saunas. There was just one lady and us there and we really enjoyed the peace and quite. It is very well decorated. The nature is also very nice there.The food was good but nothing special. Also there was just 4 dishes or so for the dinner - which is unadequate for a five star I think. The open pool surrounding seems to be pretty old and should be renovated. Still the price was not too high so I think it was quite reasonable.;Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999
A lovely Easter;5;25.03.2008;"I have just returned from a long Eastern weekend spent in this hotel, which was marvelous. We were three adults and were given by the hotel a so-called family room at the price of a double room. I say so-called, because it was actually two rooms - a huge double room with a huge wardrobe and a sitting corner and a large plasma TV, together with a little bit smaller, but also very large room with two separated beds and a huge wardrobe. There was a small corridor and a spacious bathroom with a shower. In the room we coud find slippers and bath-robes for the swimming-pool (there were also the bathrobes for kids in two different sizes), many towels in the bathroom in different sizes, including the very, very large ones to be taken to the swimming pool and all kinds of toiletries. The bed and the pillow were soooo comfy. The room had a view onto wonderfull woods of the Maribor mountains and it was really very quiet, perfect for sleaping.The breakfast and dinner bufetts offered a variety of choice and very tasty meals indeed, especially on Eastern morning. The hotel staff is extremely polite and helpfull. They seemed to be taking care of everything. There were many different thingsorganized for the kids, so that they don't get bored, but for the adults as well, including relaxation to the sounds of a gong in the wellness centre, a shuttle little train driving to the centre of Maribor and the large shopping mall of Maribor, free of charge Internet in the hotel lobby....The wellness centre is wonderfull - the swimming pool is huge with many whirpools, there is a Turkish and Finnish sauna and Finnish sauna with chromotherapy, squash, gym, bycicles to rent, a beauty salon with a large offer.....The hotel location is really perfect - you can take a \gondolla\"" to the mountains and take a walk there or do winter sports if there is snow enough. The town of Maribor, which is worth seeing as well, is away only about 10 minutes of driving.I would certainly recommend this hotel to my friends and I would return as well.""";Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999
Great Hotel Wonderful City;5;18.10.2007;We spent two nights at this hotel in September 2007. This is an amazing Hotel, beautiful, comfortable, great staff and lovely location.The hotel staff greeted us and accompanied us to our room to get settled. The room has all the amenities you could ask for. Our room was very large with a nice sized balcony overlooking the pool, terraces and country side. Beds are very comfortable with nice linens and pillows. There is a vanity area in the room as well. The bathroom was also large and had everything you might need if you hadnt packed it. We also had a seperate entry with closet, safe, robe and slippers.This hotel has a very extensive spa (we didnt use it but have heard its wonderful). The breakfast was very nice with just about every choice you could imagine. We also had lunch here order off of the menu and were very happy with the service and meal. They have a lounge for afternoon coffee and or drinks and a very large outdoor terrace with comfortable seating some covered and some not. As mentioned before if you are here during winter the ski slope is right out side. They have summer and spring activities as well, horse back riding, cycling, hiking and much more.This was our first visit to Slovenia and we will definately return as soon as we can.

Great location, not much more to say;3;26.05.2007;"Stayed there on a business trip so I didn't have time to use all the spa facilities this hotel has - and has them included in the room price. Hence this review is a bit biased in that direction.I had a very nice room with a big, comfy bed. Bathroom was clean and very OK. Because of the hotel's location at the outskirts of the town, at the bottom of a mountain, it was very quiet. I slept with open windows without problems. The TV was a huge (22\ or so) LCD device. Surprisingly, there was no Internet access in the rooms. There was an Ethernet socket in the wall, but the reception staff didn't have cables and informed the access in the rooms is not available.One could use the Internet for free by connecting at a side table near the reception - an Ethernet cable and a spare laptop were provided. On top of that there was paid Wi-Fi access in the lobby, bar and restaurant. We were all most disappointed by this.Breakfast was ok, no complaints here. Most guests were also apparently eating their dinner and lunch as a buffet at predetermined times - part of a spa package I think. We went for a la carte - and that was a bad idea. The food itself was ok - nothing to write home about, but ok. However, the service was terribly slow. Our diner lasted for more than 2 hours, most of that was waiting for the waiter to take the order and even more wait for it to be delivered. It seemed like there was just one cook in the kitchen doing all the dishes one by one. I'm sure if you take buffet you don't experience that, but unless you have a lot of time to spare don't go for a la carte. Not worth it - go to one of the fine restaurants in the Maribor town instead.""";Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999
Great Location for a Skiing Holiday;4;26.10.2006;We chose the Habakuk Hotel as there was a special offer on at the time. We travelled by Ryan Air to Graz then caught a train to Maribor. It was quite an experience but now that we have done it we wouldn't mind doing it again.The hotel was great, right next to the bottom of the ski slope so in the morning after breakfast you just hop onto the lift and away you go.The best part about this hotel is the thermal pool. It was so invigorating to spend the evening swimming in the thermal pool. The outdoor pool is linked to the indoor pool and it was amazing to be swimming under the stars with snow falling on you.I would recommend this hotel to anyone, young, old, couples, families etc. Pohorje was still undeveloped when we went so everything was great. The slopes were fantastic for all levels. We would like to return someday very soon.;Hotel Habakuk;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelHabakuk;Pohorska ulica 59, Maribor 2000, Slovenia;46.5332018;15.6010999

Average;3;13.05.2017;The only thing this hotel was good for was location and free parking. The rooms were very dated but clean and tidy. Shower doors were broken, also fairly noisy. I highly recommend spending the extra for a room with a view it will no doubt change your opinion of the property. The restauant was extremely limited with only snack food or 3 main options, very disappointing. However great food options only minutes walk or a supermarket to do your own thing. Although note that they close at 1900. The swimming pool was under renovation although not told this at time of booking.

Boring, expensive, no energy;3;2.05.2017;As Slovenian and domestic guest I should praise what is domestic, but in this case I will not. I've been in the same hotel category of the same hotel chain in Kranjska Gora before, the hotel Špik, and had better experience. Arrival at the hotel is like the first impression when you say hello to some new person who you meet. A good first impression means a lot, as well as bad impression don't on the other hand. There was two things I was quite disturbed at the time of arrival to Kompas. This is decrepit socialistic looking hotel lobby, where on the walls there are wooden panels from 70's. Come on guys, please make a renovation there. Second, below average guest reception, which I would expect more from the hostel stuff with 2* categorization. From receptionist (lady with glasses, dark hair) I would expect a smile, and welcome as it should be and above all, as a first-timer in this hotel I would expect some hotel service and amenities explanation. Instead of that I did ask for almost everything by myself. It's not hard, but some pro-activity would be nice and expected. Like »sir, yes we have wifi and is free-of-charge or you have bathrobe in your room, but be aware that you need to pay for the use of it or you have a children playground in basement, but without hotel stuff you can not get in etc«. Based on my frequent trips to the various hotels, both privately and business, and experience from that trips I would expect the usage of bathrobe free of charge. But of course nothing was mentioned that this is not free, no matter if bathrobe is in your room and there is something written on package of bathrobe (I mean here that you need to pay for it). Sleeky. Also, I was surprised by the price of 1dl of average Cabernet-Sauvignon. Price 3.30€ for 1dl of local average wine. Give me a break. In the basement you have available parking place, but of course you have to pay € 8 per day. It is also necessary to pay the usage of hotel sauna. Just be aware, this hotel is not Spa type, where you have big pools, nice and modern big saunas, great massage etc. No, it have an indoor pool where 10 people in it means crowdy situation, one nice pool for children and one jacuzzi. And saunas near by for the extra price of 13-15€. Rooms are suitable for hotel with 4 *. Spacious enough, with a comfortable bed, LED TV, a sufficiently large bathroom and safe. So what average guest needs. Cleanliness is also on the expected level. For the room I do not have any complaints. Everything is ok. Food in the hotel is somewhere at the level of 3 * hotel. The taste of the food is not critical. It was quite ok and well prepared. I would recommend that hotel offer more meal choices. 3-4 different dishes and that's all. Plus average salad bar, below average selection of pastries and of course, pricey drinks for dinner. Breakfast choices are also not more than standard of good 3* hotel. Lobby, as I already mentioned, is outdated. Some old soffas with bar in the lobby for which you don't have a feeling that exist. No energy from the bar and barmen, so you will not find any guests there having fun. My recommendation to new guests is that they need to have eyes open. Things that are in most other hotels or much cheaper or even free are charged here. At the end you fill like »oh, I need to pay for that and I need pay too much«. Would I visit this hotel again? Nope. Boring hotel, nothing much to do, no real energy from stuff. Average hotel. That's it. I was expecting somehow more from 4* hotel.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Clean, functional hotel but not much to o say beyond that;3;1.05.2017;The rooms in this hotel were extremely dated and tired. They were lacking in facilities for a 4 star hotel.Sadly a great location but overall the hotel is lacking in any atmosphere. It's like they just gave up trying a while ago. It appears that the management at this hotel are more interested in coach parties than the individual travellers, a situation which clearly pays the bills. All of the facilities offered point towards this fact and have a conference/mass catering feel about them. There is bar which has zero atmosphere which feels like a smaller version of the breakfast room which again is completely lacking in warmth and character.We had the misfortune of being located at one of the rooms at the front, which from a noise perspective was horrendous. The rooms are so hot that you have to have the window open. The coaches from the tour groups (apart from taking up a large percentage of the car parking space in a small car park) start revving their engines early ad there is a huge amount of noise from the volume of customers boarding the bus that you simply cannot sleep from about 0730 onwards. In addition to this here are some of the other issues we found.....Pool - no additional pool towels provided, you were expected to use the towels from your room.Weather - this is a known 'wet' location in April yet no umbrella provided in the room and on asking at reception they continually advised that they had 'run out'.Room Temp - Ridiculously hot and unable to control the temp as the air con control had no effect what so ever.Facilities - no in room tea and coffee. Curtains did not block out the light. Tatty carpet in room. Absolutely no surfaces in bathroom to layout toiletries. Maid service - atrocious! Bed barely looked different after getting out of it to it being 'made up'. Pillows and throw just dumped on the side every day.Breakfast - unable to get a table in the early part of breakfast due to the number of coach party guests. Breakfast ran till 1030 but very little produce topped up after 0945.I checked out and the girl on the reception didn't have the interest to even ask me if I'd enjoyed my stay! There was one member of staff who was pleasant and helpful , don't know his name, a guy with glasses. However, he was almost alone except for some of the breakfast staff who seemed to be crying out for people to engage with them just so they could chat and be friendly. It's sad that a hotel with such a lovely location should not be a consideration for a revisit when we come back next year. It just seems that whoever is running this hotel has given up on the individual traveller and has given up on injecting a life and personality into the place.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Breakfast very good, dinner could be better;5;1.05.2017;Rooms are big and clean, staff is very friendly and helpful. Location is perfect - in the center of Kranjska gora close to everything.

Great place;5;26.04.2017;It has great views of the castle. Very friendly staff, nice breakfast, good WIFI, free parking.We got a double room on the top floor which was very big and comfortable.

excellent, would definatly recommend;5;10.03.2017;We had a party of 10 people staying here last week, March 2017. the hotel was lovely the staff where very friendly and helpful. the package we got was brilliant. maybe a little too many students in the ski school. me and my partner booked a private 2 hour ski lesson and benefitted so much more from that. The area is beautiful and the skiing is great. the food was also up to a great standard, every night there was plenty of choice and all was fresh and presented beautifully.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Skiing holiday booked with Crystal Ski;5;24.02.2017;I had a few reservations about this hotel after reading earlier reviews however we have just spent a fantastic week here. The rooms are spacious, clean and warm. The food has been really good with lots of choice. There has even been food specific for children in the evening. Whether this is because of it being half-term I am not sure but we have not gone short of food. The swimming pool area is also very good. The water temperature is not too bad and again all very clean. I would highly recommend this hotel and I look forward to our last night here tonight.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Close to the slopes;4;24.02.2017;Three of us stayed for a week of skiing on a half board basis.Room was warm, large, clean with free WiFi everywhere. The decor of the hotel was a bit dated, but clean and with friendly staff. That's not a complaint because it had most of the amenities we needed. The breakfast buffet was great, good selection for those of us who just wanted a bowl of cereal or the big eaters who needed a full cooked breakfast. The only disappointment was the orange and tropical juices, they were a bit watery.The evening meal was again run as a buffet, with a good selection of stuff to choose from. The soups were good (except the potato on Thursday that was a bit cold). The daily pasta choice was ideal for the small eater.The pool was clean and well managed. The jacuzzi/hot tub could have been warmer. But the biggest downside was the charge for the sauna (didn't try that, it just seemed to be too expensive).The only things we would have liked extra were a laundry room and a guest kitchen with microwave and kettle. There were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Great location;4;21.02.2017;The hotel reception area and bedrooms were good, clean and comfortable.

Great ski yrip;4;20.02.2017;A group of 9 adults and teenagers stayed here and really enjoyed it. Excellent location only a couple of minutes from the slopes, great bar area to meet up after skiing. Very relaxed atmosphere. Breakfast was a really good choice and rooms were quiet, comfortable with nice views. Dinner buffet was also good value. Staff were helpful. Hot tub was the only disappointment as it was lukewarm, even after we complained. However we were able to use the facilities at the Ramada hotel across the road which were great. No coffee making facilities in rooms but coffee from the bar was only 1.5 Euros! Would come again.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
So-so beautiful;5;29.01.2017;I loved the rooms and the pool and basically everything about this hotel. It really had it all and is one of the quietest places I have ever been to.

Food poor and no tap water allowed!;2;16.01.2017;My husband and son were very sick mid way through our skiing holiday. They both ate chicken and bolognese in the restaurant in the evening. I was unaffected as I'm a veggie. Vegetarian food was very limited. The hotel do not allow you to order tap water with your evening meal, you have to pay for bottled water, even if you are ordering wine, beer and fruit juices for the children. I found this outrageous. The Hotel Lec and The Bor restaurant next to the hotel allow tap water and I presume the other hotels do too. It is purely a money making idea from the Restaurant Manager, who I tried to speak to on numerous occasions but he wasn't on duty the times I requested him. The restaurant staff knew I was unhappy but never once tried to rectify the issue and questioned me on the third night as to where I had bought my water from when I arrived in the restaurant. After this happened I refused to buy anymore drinks at the hotel and bought wine and soft drinks from the local supermarket and drank them in the room ( which has a fridge) The supermarket is very cheap and has a great selection of food and drink. The hotel is in a good location to the slopes and if you are happy with paying for water every evening, as well as your alcohol and possibly getting food poisoning, then book this hotel, if not, choose another hotel.It is a real shame that the restaurant food, restaurant rules, restaurant manager and staff are so poor because the hotel itself and the other staff are ok.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877

not a great place;3;30.11.2016;A bit disappointed overall. The reception staff was friendly, but the hotel not very clean, with poor facilities.

Really nice place;4;4.11.2016;I went for a debating camp and ended up staying in this wonderful hotel. It is surrounded by a scenic landscape and is nestled right at the heart of kranjska gora. I loved the rooms and the bathroom. The ball room in the hotel also was very well maintained and I had a great experience there. The only major problem was the food, as I am an Indian and I only eat egg. Therefore I didn't find the choice of food enough for me and thus ate most of my meals outside the hotel. The pool and the jacuzzi were in mint condition.I recommend this place as I had a good experience here.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Rather 3 stars;3;21.10.2016;I've just come back from my business trip in Krjanska Gora, I've stayed in this hotel for five days. Rooms are big, mine had a really nice view however there are few negative points: dust in the bathroom on the radiator and hair dryer, in the room was too hot, the evening service during our first evening in the bar and the restaurant wasn't nice and the food wasn't really warm.

I would choose different next time;3;29.09.2016;"Hotel Kompas is on a hill with very nice views if you get the right room. There are private balconies. Bed was comfortable; linens, especially towels, were nice. Had heated drying racks in bath. However, housekeeping was not that great. Wastebasket was not emptied one day. Bed was sloppily made. The bathroom was terrible. I'm 5' 2\, and the tub was very tall. The location for stepping (climbing in my case) into the tub was only 18\"" or less from the tub which was awkward. There was one bar which made getting in easier, but not helpful getting out. I twisted my ankle the last day trying this trick. Also, carpet was very soiled.I mentioned hotel is on a hill. There were many, many stairs to get to City Center. Very tiring for older travelers.

Late Summer holiday;4;17.09.2016;"Booked the Kompas through Thomson Lakes and Mountains at relatively short notice for a late summer break. The hotel is ideally situated on the outskirts of the town, about a five-minute walk from the centre; the main chair-lift is also close at hand. Our room had twin beds rather than the double bed I thought we had booked, it also had a balcony which we hadn’t booked; that said, as far as I could tell from the outside, the majority of rooms seemed to have some sort of balcony, whereas I am sure Thomson were charging a supplement for rooms with this facility – caveat emptor! The décor is perhaps a little dated, however the view from the room was outstanding. There is no air conditioning which at this time of year was not a problem as the temperature dropped at night, however I wonder what it would have been like in the height of summer? The style of meals was buffet for both breakfast and dinner. Breakfast comprised the usual continental style breakfast and was excellent. The only slight criticism I would make is that the fruit juice, which came from an automatic dispenser, tasted as if it had been diluted; however, I have experienced similar in other hotels in Austria, so perhaps this is just the way such things are done in this part of Europe. Dinner comprised soup, salad and an eclectic selection of main courses and desserts. Generally, there was something to suit all tastes, however there was one evening where I struggled to find a main course which appealed. The ambience in the dining room was more canteen than restaurant but the provision was generally adequate.It would be interesting to go back to the hotel in the skiing season, however, whilst we enjoyed our holiday, I think we will be leaving it a few years before we return to Kranjska Gora for a summer holiday.";Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877

As for the hotel good selection of food even if you are a vegetarian good salads and well cooked. rooms comfy, no air con but before you say thats no good the temperature drops at night so you don't need it. staff friendly speak very good english. this hotel is only ten - 15 minutes into Slovenia and 15 minutes from italy by car so goo base point.

Lovely;4;25.08.2016;Just come back from 10 days in wonderful Kranjska Gora. Were originally booked to stay at the Ramada Resort Hotel, just across the road, but were transferred to the Kompas after 2 nights because of accommodation unsuitability. Were made extremely welcome by the Kompas staff - special mention to Miha. Our room was spacious, spotless and comfortable, with a gorgeous view of the Julian Alps. The food was very nice with ample choice. The swimming pool is a little bit on the small size and guarded by a fairly grumpy-looking lifeguard, but guests at the Kompas can enjoy the fab Larix pool at the Ramada Resort across the cross, at no additional costs. I guess it would have been nice to have occasional evening entertainment and tea-making facilities in the room, but this would definitely not stop us from visiting the Kompas again.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
short summer break;4;16.08.2016;Stopped here for three nights as part of a two week holiday.

Very good hotel, delicious food, pleasant staff;4;2.08.2016;Placed in the middle of mountains and near the town centre but very peaceful, also good pool. Water was delicious from the tap but quite expensive in the hotel, served from the bottle. I would recommend that the hotel uses more environment friendly policy: serve cooled tap water to guests with the price 2 euros per litre. Also it would be better if we would have the opportunity to use the towels a bit longer than one day ...

Strange rules on water in the dining room but great staff.;4;15.06.2016;We enjoyed our time at the Komas. The staff were almost all very helpful, especially in the bar. I was very annoyed though that they refused to serve tap water in the dining room. We were expected to buy a new plastic bottle of water at each meal which I refused to do. When I took water in with me I was asked not to do it, despite the fact that you could easily get glasses of tap water and hot water from the bar anytime. Very strange.There was also no provision for keeping your towels for another day, so not many green points there.There was a large variety of food on offer at breakfast and evening and the rooms were very comfortable.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Enjoyable stay;4;8.06.2016;We stayed at the Kompass after booking a holiday with Thomson's holidays. The hotel was well located and spotlessly clean. Our towels were changed every day, the buffet breakfast and dinner offered plenty of choice and it was a generally well run hotel.We found that the room safe was not working and that the shower in our room would sometimes become scalding hot for no apparent reason. On reporting these issues to the hotel manager who was called Sanja they were both fixed within a couple of hours which was impressive.The only negative points for us were that the hotel did not offer any coffee/tea making facilities in the room and a lady who we got to know on holiday asked for a jug of tap water with her dinner only to be told that she would need to buy bottled water from the bar which seemed unreasonable. I know from talking to other holiday makers that other hotels eg Ramada and Lepa did offer coffee/tea making facilities.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877

Lovely hotel and well located for the slopes;5;17.04.2016;We visited this hotel for a weeks ski break during the February half term holiday 2016. (Sorry for the late review) The hotel booking was part of a learn to ski package which was arranged through Crystal ski holidays which provided an excellent service.The Kompas is an excellent family oriented hotel and ideally located for the slopes and the main hire shop which are only a few minutes walk away. A few more minutes walking brings you to the main square of KG which has some lovely restaurants, cafes and a picturesque church. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable with some offering balconies and baths at a supplement. Our room was a very spacious quad with bathroom and included a fridge. Ski storage and drying facilities were also provided on the basement level. The restaurant was excellent and provided self service breakfast and evening meals. Waiter service for drinks. There was a good choice of hot and cold breakfast offerings as well as evening meals. The hotel also has a pool and spa area but I think that the spa area was 'natural' so not for the kids. If you timed it right the pool could be very quiet. On the first morning the ski hire shop was very chaotic as a lot of people tried to collect the hire equipment before the morning lessons. This process was further complicated by the lack of communication that failed to inform everyone that you had to use a touch screen to pre register your hire before queueing at the hire desk. This resulted in lots of people queuing for a long time only to be told that they needed to join the queue at the pre registration screen. Very annoying.The ski school started at 09.00 and finished at 11.00. It's the first time that we had morning only lessons but that meant that the afternoon could be spent practicing, relaxing or sightseeing. In some regards it might have been easier for lessons to start and finish an hour later as an 09.00 start was clearly a struggle for some families with younger children. Nevertheless the ski package was brilliant and the instructors spoke excellent English. A real treat was the night ski option where the slopes were floodlight and reopened for skiing between 7 & 10 pm.Crystal offered some full day and half day excursions and we opted to see Lake Bled and Lubjiana which were both very interesting and well worth a look if you visit in either winter or summer.Overall, the whole experience was excellent as was the hotel Kompas. Well recommended.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877

Hotel Kompas: A really excelent choice at Kranjska Gora;5;27.02.2016;First of all it has the best location possible and is the first hotel you see when you arrive. It is literally in the center of Kranska Gora, two steps out and you have everything there. The rooms are nice and big, with some looking at the mountains with very impressive views at the sunset, this is really a plus because most of other hotel rooms are looking towards the ski tracks. The Spa has two saunas and a steam bath with a complete relax area. All the staff is really very gentle. This hotel is under the direction of Miss. Rada Rajlic, a very kind and intelligent manager that knows how to make you feel cared. I want to write this review also because I have found a lot of not positive comments about the meals in this hotel, and this is unfair. We stayed 4 nights and therefore we were able to taste both the quality and diversity of their menus. The overall impression is very positive because each dinner was quit distinctive, varied from the starter to the dessert, with high quality products and well prepared and cooked. The same can be said for the breakfast. The Half Board in this hotel corresponds to that of an excelent four stars hotel. When you put all together, you understand that it is a very good choice for making your vacations in a special wilderness, but with all the conforts.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Good holiday base for a half term week skiing in Kranjska Gora!;4;23.02.2016;The Hotel Kompas is a great base for a week's skiing in Kranjska Gora. Ideally situated 5 minutes walk from the ski school meeting place (10/15 minutes if your carrying kids skis etc as well as your own). The room we had (for 2 adults and 2 children) was spacious and ideal layout for our family. We did have an issue with an incredibly noisy Slovenian (?) school party that were there at the same time though. They kept running up and down the corridors noisily and trying to open room doors. We did report the issue to the reception who said they would send someone up, but it made no difference. We also spoke to the staff with the trip, who to be honest didn't seem to care at all.Having said that though, the hotel worked well for us. Food combinations were sometimes a little random, but we always managed to find something to eat. We were particularly grateful for the cold platter served when we arrived late Saturday evening and the breakfast pack up they gave us when our Crystal coach turned up to collect us at 4.40am to return to Salzburg airport.Ski conditions were fab for February - we had a plentiful supply of snow. We enjoyed the skiing and the tuition in the Intersport Bernik school was good - although there was a nightmare chaos at the ski hire shop when we were collecting equipment at the beginning of the week. Has to be expected though I suppose for the busiest time of the year for them. We skied every morning and then enjoyed a restaurant lunch at the Bor pizzeria place between the hotel and the slopes (well worth a visit). We then spent the afternoon in the hotel pool - which was brilliant for a family with two children who simply couldn't keep skiing all day. We also had plenty of goes at bumboarding - initially for 10 Euros at the Crystal Ski bumboarding Olympics. We then bought our own bumboards from the Intersport store in the town for about 6 Euros.Kranjska Gora still seems to be working out how to organise being a top skiing resort, but it is beautiful and all in all a fabulous family holiday. We will definitely go skiing again.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Winter escape;4;26.01.2016;Stayed last week for three nights at this delightful hotel. Very nice pool area, if you are there in the summer there are grassy areas outside to enjoy. Because it was quiet, we had the pool to ourselves a couple of times. Pleasant room, helpful staff, very good breakfast choice.I am not sure what Bled would be like with summer crowds, but if you like peace and quiet with frosty lakeside walks, its a delightful time to visit. Worth a meal at the castle, run by local catering college, and catching a local bus (frequent and cheap) to beautiful Lake Bohinj, real lakeside isolation and stunning setting. About thirty minutes, scenic ride. There is a lot going on in event terms over Christmas and New Year, so perfect for a break then, the trees and nativity scenes were only just coming down last week!;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Nice hotel, close to SKI center;4;18.01.2016;This hotel is 100 m from ski slopes. It is warm, rooms are clean, and although it is a bit old it is renovated recently. We had a three bed room with one extra bed and it was not to spacious, but despite that it was ok. Breakfast was ok, always something to pick from, and suppers were even better. Only problem we had is when some nordic skii competitors came and then there were lines for supper :)Hotel has a small pool, with luke warm water, and one smaller for the children. Also a jackuzzi, and sauna. Play center for kids is not to big (one pool with coins, one mini football, table tenis and darts), but when there is snow - who needs it :)Ski depot is underground, so there is a bit going on up, and down the stairs with skiis everyday...;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Good choice!;4;10.01.2016;Old hotel, but well maintained. Good stuff, warm, convenient for skiing. Breakfast is average. Did not like the waterbed at all!

Very Well 4 star Hotel;4;17.11.2015;I have been to Kompas Hotel for business with a group of 5 colleagues. I like hotel very much. Good sizes rooms, lovely indoor pool area, friendly staff and nice breakfast. We did not have a dinner in this hotel but breakfast was bey high standard. Everything you could think of.Hotel is situated 5 mns from slopes and resort center. Highly recommended.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Comfortable, good location, poor catering;4;21.10.2015;The hotel is very comfortable, rooms well appointed and very clean. Staff excellent and very friendly. Good swimming pool and a pleasant outdoor area for a drink or coffee. The coffee from the bar was first rate but the same cannot be said for the coffee in the restaurant at breakfast, it was appalling as was most of the food in the evening. The breakfast selection was satisfactory. There was an enormous choice for the evening meal but the quality of the cooking was very poor, so bad in fact that we gave up on it and ate out. Slovenia is a beautiful country and I intend to return for skiing but I will be self-catering, the supermarkets are excellent.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Mass market catering;2;24.09.2015;Stayed 1 week but realised after 1 day that the hotel was catering for overnight coach parties.These groups normally use chain hotels off motorways on the edge of large towns but the Kompas seems to heavily encourage this market.Each afternoon several large coach parties would arrive and all leave the following morning this meant the hotel became virtually a processing unit for travellers,the strain is evident when it comes to dining.The restaurant is packed at dining times with seating priority given to the overnight groups. I was only allocated my own table on my 5th day and this was after the restaurant manager on the previous evening told me in a very rude and obnoxious manner that I was at the wrong table.The food is a product of large scale catering with the predictable unimaginative bland fare repeated every 2/3 days,the fresh fruit selection was particularly poor and the ice cream cabinet was only available 1 day.Breakfast was a similar event but buffet breakfast is a pretty standard meal in any hotel.The hotel itself is quite adequate with decent rooms and standards of cleanliness and the staff are all efficient and helpful including the restaurant waiting staff (with the exception of the restaurant manager).Kranjksa Gora is a lovely place to visit with stunning scenery but part of your holiday experience is the enjoyment of your evening meal and this was not possible at the Kompass.I shall visit Kranjska Gora again but I am afraid that under the current regime I would not stay at the Kompass as I believe each guest should be treated personally and respectfully but this was not my experience.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Beautiful hote;5;15.09.2015;Beautiful hotel, with nice staff. The rooms are big and clean. The food is really delicious and there is really always enough to choose what will you eat.

Food and Restaurant service Poor;3;30.08.2015;The food and restaurant service at this 4 star hotel is poor! The choice of food on the buffet at both breakfast and evening meal is also very limited. Whilst there is a varied choice of meat dishes, they are not very appetising. Dishes are not replenished on the salad bar and dessert/fruit selections, so if you are not having your meal at the start of the meal time, you have even less choice. The waitresses/waiters are more interested in setting the tables for breakfast, than serving you with drinks for your evening meal. You have to ask them several times to come for the order, and then you have to remind them that you have not yet received your drinks. This spoilt an otherwise fantastic holiday in a brilliant location.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Good hotel in lovely alpine village;4;22.08.2015;We stayed one night in our walk of the Soca Valley trail. It's a nice and comfortable hotel with efficient staff and a plentiful buffet at dinner and breakfast. We didn't use the spa or pool so can't comment on those but our room was very spacious and had a balcony with a splendid view. Kraska is a beautiful little town in stunning countryside and the Kompas a decent base for a couple of days.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
hotel kompas standard;3;14.06.2015;having just returned from this hotel we were very very dissapointed with the standard of food served in the restaurant mostly all the food was cold and was also served on cold plates when i complained was told that this would be corrected and it seemed to be for 2 days then back to normal cold again the same thing happened at breakfast with eggs and bacon all cold in fact the food is not as good as a two star pension and for a four star hotel is shocking DO NOT STAY HERE UNLESS YOU LIKE COLD FOOD;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Great Hotel, Service, Food, Room, close to ski lift, will come back again!;4;16.03.2015;This is an excellent 4 star hotel. All staff is extremely friendly and willing to help at any time. Hotel has a good location (30 meters walking to the ski lift), breakfast, dinner buffet were really good with lot of choices. Room was good, well organized, with a balcony (benefit for smokers :).

Wonderful Family Holiday;5;2.03.2015;We stayed here in Feb 2015 half term with our 2 children (14 and 10) and brother-in-law, niece 11 and nephew 8. We booked through CrystalSki. Welcome at The Kompas on arrival was quick and efficient. We had a fantastic room. Large bed for ourselves and the children had their own beds in corners of the room. We also had a large table in the middle which was great for the evening for playing card games. Shower/toilet room was large and clean and there was loads of storeage (brother-in-law was also happy with his room). We also had a great view of the slopes. The staff were all amazingly polite and helpful and spoke excellent English. There was a great choice of food (we stayed half board) and I liked the fact that we had the same table each time we ate. My children are quite fussy eaters (not very adventurous!) but they had a good selection everyday. Hotel is a short walk to the slopes, nearby bars and restaurants.The reception area has a bar, great fireplace and large comfy sofas to accommodate bigger groups. A great atmosphere.I would highly recommend The Kompas and we are already looking to book again for next year!;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Excellent hotel, friendly staff, great for families;5;22.02.2015;We stayed here in Feb 2015 with our 2 children who are aged 6 and 8. We came to Kranjska Gora last year so we knew where the hotel was in relation to the local town. It is in an excellent location with just a short walk into the town as well as a short walk to the slopes, useful when you have got to carry childrens skis as well as your own! There is a ski locker in the basement of the hotel and you just leave a small deposit for the key. As the hotel was not full they let us have 2 lockers which was great. The room size was fantastic. We had a king size bed and the children had a proper single bed each which was great. There was also a separate table in the room and 3 chairs a there was still loads of room. There was lots of storage space so we could put everything out of the way and it was nice and clean. I couldn't fault it.We made lots of use of the pool in the hotel. We regularly had the place to ourselves in an afternoon and it was great just being able to go down in the swimming costumes and robes provided by the hotel. They have robes for the children too if you ask at the reception. The pool had floats available and was always a nice temperature and the childrens pool was lovely and warm.We are not particularly fussy eaters and thought the food in the hotel was great with plenty of choice. Loads of different meat, fish, veg and salads. There were always 2 soups available which were nice and there was always a pasta and sauce too. For pudding there was always lots of fruit as well as desserts. Breakfasts were also very varied with lots of choice - cereal and dried fruit, pastries, toast, sausages, eggs and ham and cheese etc.I would definitely stay here again and it would be my first choice of hotel if we come back.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877

Fantastic stay at the Kompas;5;30.09.2014;We spent 4 nights here as part of a coach tour and was ideal. The reception staff were very welcoming and check in was executed in a very efficient manner.We had a room (on floor 2) with a balcony with the mountains as an ever changing view.The room was clean and although opposite the lift, was very quiet when inside.The buffet breakfasts and dinner were of a very good quality, but in leaning towards the local cuisine meant that to some, part of the fare was unexpected. But for ourselves everything was OK.Prices in Slovenia were very good - coffee from the bar in an evening was €2.20 and good quality.Check out was also efficient.In the village there is a museum - it is well worth visiting and I think it was €2.50, it is a traditional farmhouse laid out as it was a good few years ago.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877

nice break;4;31.07.2014;"my family and i have recently come back from here on a 7 day holiday with inghams , we found the hotel clean , nicely laid out and the bedrooms spacious and comfy ( top floor ) the rooms had small windows but still a lovely view ,the hotel is surrounded by mountains , the free wifi was a big bonus at night for entertainment we are not one for bars and clubs , and after a hectic day, we just needed to chill after tea ( starts at 6;30 ) . The food was buffett style and for us that was ideal , we are not fussy eaters but do like a choice and my teenagers can eat a lot , nice selection of salad , hot meats , veg , rice dishes , and desserts, there was always plenty, and fruit, ice cream was served twice , this was altered slightly each night and i found it sufficient and tasty , my only gripe and it is the only one was drinks !! having paid for half board i do expect at least water offered at night on the table ,you are expected to pay 2.70 each for a soft drink every night , so for a family of four that soon adds up onto your budget , i refused to pay this and after being told off for bringing bottled water in , we waited till we got back to our rooms and had a drink there ( no kettles either in rooms ) , this is a european thing , we found the same in austria , not just this hotel , i just think its wrong that you should not be offered at least a jug of water .Breakfast was buffett style again , even had fresh cooked waffles a couple of times , a nice treat , the cereals were bland , but there was still plenty to fill us up for our busy days .There is a swimming pool and jacuzzi these were not over busy and again clean and warm, we booked rental bikes through the hotel and received a 10% discount , the area itself is quite and beautiful , you need the local buses to get around if you wish to travel further afield , we had a great rep on hand , but there is a pc in the lobby which can be used if you want to peruse the internet for help , all in all we found this a lovely hotel to stay in for a week ( wouldn't suggest longer ) and a nice resort for exploring .";Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
What more do you need?;4;8.06.2014;Stayed here for 1 week at the start of June. We stayed on a half board basis, this being the second time we have stayed here. The rooms are good, plenty of storage space and a small fridge. We didn't have a balcony room this time and maybe I would suggest you try and get a room with a balcony as these appeared to be slightly bigger. The food was fine, nothing brilliant but plenty of choice for breakfast and at dinner there was always enough, soup, reasonable salad bar and normally 3 choices of meat dishes and 1 fish. Desert tended to be cake or fruit and only once in the week did they put on ice cream. It coincided with the 1 day we had no large coach parties. The hotel has a small bar but it is expensive compared to the local bar which is only 200m away. The hotel does also have a small indoor pool with a jacuzzi which is great to use after a day waking or cycling. Didn't have a massage or treatment but they are available at reasonable (for a hotel) prices.The staff were fine, they are not overly friendly or intrusive but are polite and efficient. Some bits of the hotel are showing their age but nothing a small tidy up won't fix (stair carpet and 1st floor walls)Overall, good clean hotel offering good value for money with all the facilities you would want.

Poor service and dated hotel;2;6.01.2014;"I stayed at this hotel during new year's, i tend to agree with most comments i.e. the staff doesn't seem to be that friendly or helpful, although some are very kind, like the lady at the bar or the housekeeping; the hotel overall needs some refurbishing; there is no bell boy or concierge, when you arrive you have to bring your own luggage to the room, and nobody comes to show you the way or the room; when you arrive you have to get close to the bar blocking the entrance to make it open, but when you leave you have to ring them and wait for someone to answer and ask you how may they help you (what's the point of that, it should be the other way round). The restaurant is alright, for 7 euros i wasn't expecting much, and it was actually better than expected, there are no real queues to get food as you can move around the different options, and food keeps coming from the kitchen when it finishes in the trays, the real disappointment was new year's eve gala dinner, 75 euros for a slightly more complex menu but with no beverages included in the price, i think for 75 euros they could have at least included water and a house wine. This was a big disappointment, and what's the point in beginning new year's dinner at 19:30?! At 21 we were all done and had to wait 3 hours for midnight, i barely made it and the whole excitement by then was gone, i just wanted to go to bed. The swimming pool is tiny, cold and full of kids splashing around. They allow people from the outside so it's very crowded, it should be left only for hotel guests, as it's so tiny. I stayed there 10 minutes and left, sauna and other services cost about 30 euros, very disappointed.Overall it's barely a 3 stars to my standards, it lacks the services of a 4 stars.";Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877

Lost their compass?;3;2.09.2013;"Room is comfortable, nice furniture, bathroom has a tub. Well, however there were ants around mini-bar/TV desk - not many, in fact when I trown away one, another one appeared, I never saw more than one at a time - in the end, I counted them 8 in first day! Balcony is \shared\"" with people next door - bordered with few shacks - I didn't like that very much. I like privacy when I wander around in my underpants. Free wi-fi - my experience was like this - there are 3 access points to connect to. Two are called by hotel, the third one is called guest. I couldn't connect to first two, I had connecting and disconnecting IP message in loop. The guest one has weak signal and it works only at certain parts of the room - in general, not at the desks where you could put laptop. You have to confirm connection and it last until you disconnect, then you have to repeat the process. At the end of day, the ones with stronger signal started to work suddenly, I could connect to them -and they worked fine the rest of the time. The air-refresher (or whatever it's called in english) controlled by switch in bathroom when it was turned on, emitted smelly odour, so it was better turned off. When I took a bath in tub (not shower - a bath), the whole floor in the bathroom was wet - thus the smell. So my guess is that since I booked the room as a part of discount on booking.com, that they have a few rooms that stay unvisited and hotel lowers their price to sold them. The other side of coin are ants and clogged pipes - since no one was obviously in the room for a quite some time. Showering went fine ie. the floor didn't get inundated by sheer showering.About pricing - When you book a room, they charge immediately the whole amount from the credit card, probably so people won't run away :D I won't be coming back here. I don't know how could they have 4 stars and won gold award for 2012 - based on what? At the last day you get questionnaire laying on the bed, about your stay.Hidden charge (as with all hotels in Slovenia) are 3 euro - to be exact, touris tax is €2.02 and insurance is €0.98.It wouldn't be fair to give lower rating than 3 - the breakfast was the best I ever had in any hotel until now. In general, rooms are Ok, they are clean, and they are cleaned ok (I don't count harmless insects in this :D )And, oh, the old geezers that praise this hotel - it is probably because there is a porn channel (channel 13 as I remember, \""XXL\""). :D""";Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877

The location is great, just a couple of minutes away from the centre of Kranjska Gora. The facility is modern. Rooms are clean with a balcony to relax on. Staff was professional and polite and we felt like at home.The food was very good and there was plenty of choices for breakfast and for dinner (buffet).The only negative that we can think off were the mattresses that were too soft and we had our backs hurting after a night sleep.We definitely recommend.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
10 days in lovely location;4;25.06.2013;We had 10 days at Hotel Kompass and throughly enjoyed our stay. The room was compact and spotless my only gripe was no air-conditioning (temperatures most days were 30 degrees) so we had to leave doors open!The staff were very helpful and friendly and the food was acceptable I did get a bit fed up with breakfast after a few days but could always manage to find something to eat. The location of Kranjska Gora is stunning beautiful walks all around and good access to places nearby on the public transport. All in all a wonderful holiday.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
An enjoyable week despite the weather;4;22.05.2013;My wife and I have just returned to UK after a week at the Kompas Hotel. Our room was clean and comfortable and a decent size. We found all the staff cheerful and always prepared to give help and advice.The down side with the room was that it had no air conditioning and so we slept with our balcony door open,which was ok until 5 am when suppliers wagons started arriving,as our balcony was above the loading bay. Our biggest disappointment was with the food which was all buffet style. Generally everything was overcooked.Meat dishes were lumps of gristly meat submerged in thick gravy or sauce. Vegetables seemed to be of the tinned variety and pasta was stodgy. We have eaten buffet food in lots of hotels and from our experience this was some of the worst. Having said that, I wouldn't rule out staying at the Kompas as the positives outweighed the negatives and we enjoyed our week even though we had five days of wet weather,.Kranjska Gora is great for anyone who enjoys walking and Alpine scenery.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Great location and lovely views good value hotel.;3;3.03.2013;stayed 1 week feb 2013 with my husband. We re in our late 20s and it was our first snowy holiday. We flew into salzburg so had a 3hr transfer which was a pain but the scenery is amazing on route. Hotel is clean and has everything you need. The location is good for slopes and village really easy access to everything. We didnt prebook anything as we wanted to wait and see what we fancied doing day by day. We hired skis and snowboards from intersport at the bottom of the slope you get discount if youre staying at the kompas prices around 15 half day 28 full day skis or snowboard both with boots and can return til 10pm. Lift passes available at the slopes at 30 full day. The hotel is very warm so take some cool clothing for when you are in the room or at dinner. We had our big window open whenever possible. Food at hotel was better than expected we were half board and had dinner at the hotel every night there was always something good. Only small issue was the lack of manners from hotel staff. Not a big deal just noticable. Our room had a stunning view of the mountains and the village is beautiful. We did two afternoon trips to the capital City and Lake Bled. Dont miss Bled it's not too far and really Lovely to See. was busy due to it being half term Locally. Lovely place and good value hotel.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Great location, just need to improve food.;4;26.02.2013;Stayed in Hotel Kompas for Feb half term, it was our first family ski holiday and was a great choice. The hotel is in a great location for both ski-ing (just over the road) and the village. Had a family room which was basic but large and comfy with a very good shower. Would recommend taking a kettle & tea bags as we would have appreciated a hot drink in the room whilst relaxing after ski-ing. There's a mini bar in the room which we used to store drinks bought at the local supermarket (where prices are very reasonable 1euro for a bottle of beer).Used the leisure facilities to relax, pool was perfect temperature for a swim and was never busy.The only disappointment was the food, breakfast was the usual buffet and adequate. The evening meals were again buffet style, we are not a fussy family but found the food rather bland and unimaginative. Drinks in the hotel are more than in the local bars but are still reasonable (comparble with uk prices).We all used Inter Sport for ski lessons (see seperate review). The area is perfect for family ski-ing, beginners and intermediates. To say it was half term it was not busy with only on occassion having to queue a few mins for a lift. Night ski-ing is available on a couple of slopes every night except mon which we thoroughly enjoyed. There is an ice rink adjacent to the hotel which is reasonably priced (3euros adult, 2euros child). The area is catering for family holiday's so there is little nightlife, just what we wanted after a day's ski-ing.Eating out is cheap with portion sizing being large, you must try the Slovenia pizza's.We were travelling with Crystal and thought the kids (8 & 6) would enjoy the dog sledging, however although it was enjoyable it lasted no more than 10mins, as it cost 130euros we were left feeling ripped off.We all enjoyed Kransjka Gora and it's ski-ing environment being quiet in comparison to the more popular ski resorts that we intend to return here next year.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Good, just too hot!!;4;23.01.2013;Stayed here as a party of 6, 2 of us having booked separatly however we still managed to be sat together during all meals which was good.Hotel generally was very good, not even a minute walk from the first slopes, swimming pool, great views.We booked 2 days later than the others we travelled with and had to pay a little more as the holiday price increased. We were on the second floor and the others on the first and the room we stayed in was slightly bigger with a balcony and a larger bed, also a bath. There was a mini bar in the room however quite expensive so we did not use - also the fridge was not cold. The rooms were very clean and cleaners friendly, very powerful shower but quite tempromental when it came to switching from warm to boiling hot to freezing. Food was good, I am quite a fussy eater. Generally a different pasta and soup every night with a large range of meats and cheeses. Lots of typical 'all inclusive' desserts and fresh fruit. Although we were half board, we did think we could at least get a glass of water with our meal but this was not allowed and drinks were very expensive in the hotel. A 500ml bottle of water as 2euro 20 when the same brand of water was 50 cent in the supermarket for a 1.5 litre! We had to then pay for bottled tap water each night otherwise we would have gone thirsty. The hotel in itself was good, the only gripe we had was the heat. Everywhere was just too hot within the hotel, we slept with the door to our balcony open every night and it was -15 outside. I would definitly stay here again, and would also reccommend the hotel.Just to add, the reception is not very ambient to drink in, try Vopa bar. Also if you're stuck for lunch the pizza place 'bor' is very good. 5 euro for a large pizza which is cheaper than the burgers etc on the slopes.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Comfortable, Quiet, relaxing stay;4;13.11.2012;"We had 3 nights at this hotel during October half-term. On first arrival we thought we may be the only people at the hotel; we only saw other guests at breakfast! It was a quiet and relaxing stay with beautiful views of the mountains. There was a mix up of rooms when we arrived, which I think was down to the booking agent, but it was quickly and efficiently sorted.The Spa was small, but clean and relaxing. Although we were a little shocked to find there were no towels available - a trip back to our room to collect towels and robes was a little annoying (especially after having a massage).Breakfast was basic, although it did improve on the last day when there were more guests staying in the hotel. The bar was a bit hit or miss. Some drinks unavialble and the same cocktail was served veyr differently on separate days!?!? This was a great location for exploring this region! Would definitely consider returning to do some more walking - minus the unexpected snow in October!";Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Hotel Kompas in stunning Slov.;4;17.10.2012;We stayed in Hotel Kompas in September it was quite a nice hotel,we think it has a great location in the small town.Our room had a super view of the fantasic mountains(what a way to start the day)it was basic but very clean and comfy and had a very nice shower.The breakfast was buffet style which was good enough for us,and for tea all you can eat buffet with a good selection of fine food on every night(the food was good not great,we were happy with it).On our last night we went to a pizza palace at the bottom end of the village and it has to be maybe the best we have ever had(don't miss out)The Kompas also had a pool/jac for relaxation after our mountain walks it was also ok.We had never been to Slovenia before this holiday we must say we loved every second of our stay it was STUNNING.We walked,hired bikes,went on trains and took in some lovely sites(and the sun stayed out).we hope to go back soon.On our visit we also had a great laugh with other guests from the uk which made our stay so much fun.(and we like FUN) give it a go!!;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Very nice hotel with outstanding view;4;2.10.2012;Kransjka Gora is a wonderful place to visit if you are there for the walking. Very pleasant hotel, lovely and clean. The food was varied and good quality with self serve buffet at breakfast and dinner.Food was really nice with an excellent choice, breakfast there was every thing you could want, cereal, fruit, yoghurt, toast, ciossants, rolls, pancakes, cheese, ham and hot food sausages and selection of eggs etc, selection of juices and teas and coffee.

Room for improvement;3;22.08.2012;My wife and I have just returned from a week at the Kompas Hotel and I say from the outset that the hotel was very good but could do with a couple of improvements.From the out outset we found the staff to be faultless. They were friendly, obliging and cheerful. As far we were concerned they couldn’t be better.Public rooms were good if a little hot – but it was August. Carpets on the stairs were a little worn but OK. Our bedroom was large and very clean. Towels were changed every day. The hotel did lose a point as there was no air-conditioning and at night it was difficult to sleep because of the heat.My wife said the swimming pool was very good and again the staff there were very helpful.Food, well! Breakfast very good, a decent selection of cheese, ham, breads, fruit juice, yoghourt, fruit. For those who like egg (I don’t), there was a great variety. However the bacon was fatty and cheep and seemed to be cooked in lumps. But on the whole breakfast was fine and enjoyable.Dinner included a choice of two soups, and an excellent salad bar. The hot plate always had pasta but some of the meats were again very fatty and certainly not to my taste. Fruit was always available and ice cream was on most evenings and a selection of cakes was always available. There was a decent selection of wines although I thought them a bit pricey. Beer was €3.00 for a small bottle, local restaurants only charged €2.00 for a half litre! And if you wanted water, they would only sell bottled and not let you have tap water. (Tap water by-the-way was very safe to drink and had no aftertaste).On our last night they had what they called a ‘picnic’ but it was in fact a barbecue. The noise generated by the band was simply horrendous, boom, boom, boom until 1.00am. It wasn’t even music. I telephoned to complain and they said they could do nothing about it and remarked that I was the third to complain. I think they could have done something as the event was on their property and they even sold tickets. Despite these drawbacks, don’t be put off. The Kompas is a good hotel. It is a great location in a wonderful village. There is just room for improvement.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877

Hotel Kompas, Kranjska Gora;3;28.07.2012;We recently stayed at the hotel Kompas, on arrival we were given a different room to the one we had booked, we went down to reception to try and get the fault rectified, the receptionist was very unhelpful and offered us a different room, but without a balcony, which we had also prebooked, she was not happy when we refused this and eventually she was able to give us a double room with balcony, which we had booked. The rooms were a very big size, with a nice comfortable bed and a spacious bathroom. We only had our bath cleaned twice while we were there and we spent fourteen nights there!!. The staff in the restaurant were very helpful and they all spoke a bit of english. The food wasn't very exciting but it was all edible. Kranjska Gora is a beautiful place to visit, the scenery is stunning lots of lovely walks. If you want to visit Lake Bled and Lake Bohinj it is very difficult by bus. There is only one daily bus that goes straight to Lake Bled and that only runs Monday to Friday. There are no buses that go direct to Lake Bohinj.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Very comfortable;4;17.06.2012;I recently stayed here for a week of walking in a room with balcony - very comfortable - great shower and bed and good sized room with everything in the right place (i.e. power points near mirrors), plenty of storage and a mini bar (which we used to chill our own white wine).The staff at Reception were very friendly and helpful - we had to report two issues with our room - the latch on the door to the balcony was faulty - and a lightbulb over the bathroom mirror was out - and on both occasions, the issues were rectified very quickly. The food is good without being very exciting, but every night something different was on offer. The most enjoyable dinner was on the last evening when we were able to eat the local cuisine. We drank the house red wine with dinner and it was very pleasant (16 Euros). It can be a bit erratic at breakfast time as far as shortage of bread, or no spoons for the cereal, but the staff are quick to sort anything out if it is pointed out to them. As someone else mentioned - if there is a coach party staying at the hotel, there can be a build-up at the coffee machines. Nobody seems to drink in the bar (which is an open area near the reception). This is probably due to the fact that drinks in the nearby bars are very cheap.Kransjka Gora is a wonderful place to visit if you are there for the walking. We barely scratched the surface of the area, so will go back next year. There is a bar behind the Tourist Information Office, owned by a British guy called Jay. I can't remember the name of the bar, but he was a fantastic source of information on the great walks in the area - seemed to be more knowledgeable than the staff in the Tourist Office. He was extremely friendly and enthusiastic, and you can arrange different activities through him, such as white water rafting and hiking.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877

A Good Choice;4;3.06.2012;We have just returned from a week at this hotel. Our room was immaculate with stunning views from the balcony. The food was varied and good quality with self serve buffet at breakfast and dinner. Although it was just the two of us, the packed lunches could have satisfied a family of four!Staff were always pleasant and helpfulThe location makes a good starting point for the many walks and cycle rides from a village which was very quiet at this time of year. Just a couple of negative points when it came to dining. If your visit coincides with a large coach party, then things get a bit hectic with only two coffee/tea machines and a go slow toaster. Just time your entry and it will be fine!;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877

Brilliant hotel !;5;7.02.2012;We have just come back from a weeks holiday at this hotel. I booked it based on the reviews on here. We were not disappointed , in fact it was even better than anticipated! I travelled with my husband and two children age 3 and 6. We had a quad room which was huge, modern , two single beds at one side of room with a bigger than king size bed at the other. Very clean ( cleaner came in every day ) free wi fi in room and satalite tv with cartoon network which kept the kids happy for half hr here and there ! Room was quiet with a lovely view of slopes. We had a shower room ( again big) I guess if you wanted a room with a bath you may need to request this. There is no kettle in room but we had taken a travel one.Food was really nice with an excellent choice, breakfast there was every thing you could want, cereal, fruit, yoghurt, toast, ciossants, rolls, pancakes, cheese, ham and hot food sausages and selection of eggs etc, selection of juices and teas and coffee. Dinner was just as good with a good choice, kids always found something they liked always at least 3 meat dishes, vegetables and a couple of pasta dishes, salad , cheese and cold meats. The food is traditional. Dessert was good too with a selection of cakes, fruit and ice cream. ( My only negative was that you had to pay 2.80 euros for a bottle of water when tap water in Slovenia is drinkable).The staff were very pleasant and helpful and even allowed us to stay in our room till 12.30 when check out was 11 am.The hotel is in a great place just a walk over a small road to the slopes ( literally a minute ). Crystal told us that they were the cheapest for lift pass and skis - they are not !!! Get your lift pass from the hotel ( someone previously mentioned on here ) and get your skis from Sport Point ( its on the right looking at the slopes with orange tent at side attached to sporty bar - great for hot chocolate and hot wine ! ) Really friendly blokes in there and we also arranged a private lesson for myself and one for my sons through them. They will do you a good deal and most days gave us a sledge for free. Kids skis, boots and helmet were just 10 euros for both of them , we just had them a day at a time when we wanted them.Kranjska Gora is great for families , there is lots to do ...nursery slope with a magic carpet , slope just for sledging, ice rink, hike to see reindeer for kids ( hotel puts this on) , inflatables at the bottom of the slopes which kids sit in and get pulled round. This isnt the place for apres ski as most locals seem to drink fruit tea after a day on the slopes , Vopa Bar was probably the only bar with some life which was a nice place and just over 2 euros for a large beer.Hotel puts on a mini disco twice a week at hotel 8 till 9 o clock.Hotel has lovely pool and they even give the kids bath robes - just ask at reception.We would love to go back ! Excellent value for money.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Brilliant hotel near slopes;5;4.02.2012;Recently stayed in this lovely hotel for our childrens (ages 8 & 6) first skiing holiday.A stones throw from the nursery slopes, we couldn't fault it in any way. Sizeable clean rooms, brilliant swimming pool, a large selection of different food at each meal, friendly staff, all in what seems like a recently refurbished hotel.Would definitely return if we decide that there are enough slopes for the kids to progress on, as it is quite restricted on variation of slopes.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Excellent Hotel;5;22.01.2012;Have just returned from a skiing holiday at this hotel through Crystal / Thomson. For what we paid I cannot believe the value. Our room was large, very clean and lovely views. The hotel is quite modern and spacious with a very nice free swimming pool and hot tub and a lovely sauna area with 3 types of sauna, plunge pool and rest area although there is a 13 euro fee for this. Breakfast catered for every type of palate from cereals to cauliflower! The bacon was not best back but edible. There was fresh fruit and the usual cold meats and cheeses, eggs, waffles, pancakes etc, in fact something for everyone. Dinner was the same, buffet style. Shark was one dish on the menu the first night, I think something got lost in the translation there. The hotel is a two minute walk to the slopes and ski hire and the Vopa pub is also two minutes away with a large beer at two euros, wine at one and coffee at one. Like all hotels they charge more for drinks in the hotel, but coffee was only fractionally more expensive and the wine and beer cheaper than home. Staff all spoke English far better than my Slovenian.The locals tended to eat dinner and breakfast in a range of track suits, so quite informal.My only complaints, you had to pay for water with your meal and when you showered it would occasionally change temperature quickly so be prepared to push the head away.As far as skiing goes the resort is really only ideal for skiers up to 3 years, after that you will not be challenged, although the reds and blacks on Podkoren were good but limited. However the night skiing adds a new level. We skied from ten till two when the sun sent behind the mountain, ate, swam, slept, had dinner and skied again. So very good hotel, lovely resort, ideal for beginners and you will not be ripped off.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Very big disappointment;2;20.01.2012;Arriving at 03:00am all I wanted is to take a shower and have some sleep, instead I faced a dirty toilet I needed to clean and blood in the shower, in addition to unchanged sheets with umbilical hairs of previous guest.The reception boy told to take the room since he have no others.The room was ordered 2 weeks in advance together with other surgeon's congress members.In addition to my case to other 2 guests from the same group were offered to share a room, since they had no free rooms (regardless the order).This situation is more suitable for low class hostel rather 4* hotel.Fitness center they are promising is a room with a table tennis, and even this wasn't accessible, since following them it was rented by somebody for private use. Breakfast is also very poorAfter intervention of the travel agent (very good job) hotel administration rooms were found the next day and administration apologized.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Great Hotel, great resort - v busy over Xmas;5;1.01.2012;Eastern Bloc chic - designwise!!Big rooms (well family room was big), great staff, buzzing over Xmas, lovely pool, perfect location next to slopes, super little resort. Only gripe was the ski lift queues but that's nowt to do with the Hotel. Also kids ski school wasn't as good as previous experiences but it was a very busy time so big classes - again nothing to do with the hotel.Massive selection of food. Some dishes a little iffy and deserts not up to much but plenty of choice so you won't go hungry.

Great location, Great food selection. Great;5;31.10.2011;We spent a week at the hotel Kompas in mid-September. It was a couple of weeks from the end of the Summer season but the standard of service didn't reflect this. The hotel is located on the edge of the village with great access to ski lifts and a number of guided walking routes. We had the half-board option and couldnt fault the food. There was plenty to choose from and something for all tastes. We left a few pounds heavier than when we arrived. One thing we didn't do was drink much at the hotel bar. Prices there were around 75% of UK price equivalent but there was a much better atmosphere in the evening at the nearby Vopa Bar where drinks were around half the price. We paid extra to have a garden view room and were glad that we did. The back-drop of the mountains is something special. The room was otherwise comfortable and clean. We pretty much had the pool and jacuzzi to ourselves although the sauna did cost extra, which our holiday brochure didnt tell us. We had never been to Slovenia before but would definitely go back again. Kranjska Gora is a good location and has a really helpful tourist info office. There is also a regular bus service to Ljubljana which was easy to use. We loved it.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
great hotel, and location;5;26.10.2011;We stayed for a walking holiday and were pleasantly surprised. Location was excellent for daily walks which were signposted, fresh walk every day if required.Hotel was clean staff friendly and food good.

Great value and well positioned.;4;30.09.2011;We stayed here for a walking holiday and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The food was excellent , we were not quite sure what it would be like as it was buffet style. It gave us the opportunity to try foods we would not normally have chosen and there was pleanty of choice, it exceeded expectations. The room was clean and comfortable with a great view over the lifts and slope. The staff were both friendly and helpfull catering for all languages. We did use the pool and also found it easy to use the chair lift and hire bicycles.We managed to easily get the local bus to Lake Bled and had a trip through the Julian Alps. There are good cycle paths and walks for all levels of experience. A perfect holiday despite the one or two thunderstorms.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Great place!;5;22.09.2011;We stayed at Kompas during the sky jumps competition on Planica and it was a great place to be. In the center of the village close to everything that you need. Beautiful nature all around, great view from the room window and spacious room and bathroom.Big variety for breakfast, they even had soy milk, which was great since we are vegetarians. Big indoor pool, lots of things to do and explore. Would recommend this hotel to everyone!;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Great Centre for Exploring;5;30.08.2011;We stayed at the Hotel Kompas on our holiday through Crystal Holidays. The room was very clean and comfortable and had a balcony with lovely views of the surrounding mountains. Our accommodation was half-board and meals were excellent. The menus, both breakfast and dinner, were varied and well prepared. We enjoyed the buffet-style food as it meant we could really experiment with different foods. Local wines and beers are served, which we found excellent. The staff at the hotel were exremely friendly and helpful and all had a good command of English, which seems to be the second language in Slovenia. There is plenty to do in the surrounding area, walks of varying difficulty from gentle strolls to serious mountain hikes, cycling along the well-made cycle tracks (cycle hire is easily available). There are also chair lifts which take you to further walking opportunites. Coach excursions are many and varied, visiting the Julian Alps, Lakes Bled and Bohinj and other places of interest. Buses will take you to Ljublijana with its charm and bustle. We are considering returning and maybe next time we will hire a car to further explore the region, The Hotel Kompas will definitely be our base when we come back because of its great comfort and service. Thanks to all at the hotel for making it a perfect holiday.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
A good choice;4;25.07.2011;Just returned from a week's holiday staying at the Hotel Kompas.This hotel has good facilities and is well positioned for the centre of Kranjska Gora with its cafes, restaurants. shops etc. . The rooms were clean and comfortable and the choice of food in the restaurant, although buffet style was enjoyable.We used the indoor swimming pool on several occasions.There are plenty of activities in the area and numerous walking and cycling trails.We visit Lake Bled and also took the local bus to Ljubljana(takes up to 2 hours) well worth a day trip. We had varied weather on our trip but there is enough to do in the area to enjoy Slovenia and its culture.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
A Holiday to remember excellent :-);5;18.07.2011;Myself and my family are just back from Slovina where we stayed in Kranjska Gora at the Compass Hotel. We are a family of four I have two sons aged 4 and the younger one aged 6 months. So traveling with buggies and alot of bags etc. We traveled with Crystal Holidays which we have done on many times before and again it was an excellent choice. When we arrived at HOtel Kompas I was very impressed with the hotel are room was on the second floor in a lovely quite spot ( perfect) Breakfast each morning was from 7.30 till 10.00 and the choice was excellent from cerals to fruit , cheeses , hams hot food, pancakes the list goes on and during the full week I enjoyed the breakfast everyday. As we were halfboard we eat out for lunch in the local town or if we went on trips on the local bus ( very nice coaches) which were very local, the food was excellent and a very good price ( pizza €5-€7) Pasta €9 . We also used the pool everyday not always in our hotel as the sister hotel Larix across the road had also an even bettter pool so we swam there quite a lot ( has a life guard as well) In the evenings we eat again in the hotel dinner from 6.30-8.00 and again excellent selection of food from soup to salads to cheeses and a wide selection of main courses from Pasta to beef , chicken Lamb the list is endless... Deserts were also lovely and a selection of Ice cream which my son really enjoyed. The staff on reception were also very helful and spoke english so we never had any issue with language each day there were a number of activities on like hill walking, aerobics in the pool etc etc we didnt join any of these till the last evening and we went on the evening hike for 1 hour to the local lake by candle light , this was really intresting as the guide gave a great insight in to Kranjska Gora ( maybe should have done it on the first evening) . If your intrested in this hotel and Area you will have a fantastic holiday and stay in a really lovely hotel ...I know we did and we had a great time.During our stay the World Debate Championships were on and the hotel was very busy which was nice.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Ideal base for walkers;3;5.07.2011;"My husband and I are moderately fit for 57 year olds and came to Kranjska Gora for the walking and was not disappointed. There are plenty of walks for all types of fitness and with extremely beautiful views. We went with Crystal Lakes and Mountains on the Discovery Package which included: a walking map (extremely useful); excursion to the Julian Alps (amazing views especially as we had a clear day); Tyrolean Evening (none existent); Guided evening torch-lit walk to Lake Jasna (a waste of time); a ticket to use the Vitranc chair lifts (which we could only use Sunday as the other days useable clashed with the lakes excursion or the day we were flying home); and excursion to Lake Bled and Lake Bohinj (well worth it, unfortunately the weather was extremely damp).Hotel Kompas was very clean, neat and tidy. Our room 152 overlook the mountains like most rooms, and was quite spacious. Plenty of wardrobe and shelving space and modern bathroom. Reception staff - very helpful. Restaurant/bar staff - hard working, could be a bit more friendlier.Food edible, but not four star quality. It was a bit maddening when at breakfast sometimes there was a toaster that worked, sometimes there wasn't; sometimes there were fruit salad and bread rolls sometimes there weren't. Same at evening meals, sometimes ice cream and salad dishes, sometimes not. When I asked the waiters where certain foods were, their reply was. \Not today\"".Bar area (which merged into the reception area) had no atmosphere, we felt compelled to drink else where. There are plenty of bars and eating places in Kranjska, but in June they don't get as busy as in winter I suppose and the majority of them closed at 11pm except for the Vopa which is the closest Bar to the Kompas and the prices of drinks are very reasonable. We used the hotel swimming pool and whirl pool most days after an excursion or walk to ease our muscles, then a bit of sunbathing outside when the sun was out.We found the walking trails in Kranjska Gora not sign posted very clearly. Sometimes the rainy weather can affect the paths, so be careful. Crystal/Thomsons do provide a couple of free walking groups a week which we didn't take, but if you are unsure of routes, they are a good idea.All in all, Kranjska Gora is a beautiful village, surrounded by beautiful scenery. People shouldn't just come here for the winter sports, this place is well worth seeing in the summer. We came here to get away from it all and be in touch with nature. We succeeded.""";Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
nice hotel, great base for walking and sightseeing in Slovenia;4;14.06.2011;We stayed for a week from 21st May. Actually booked the Alpina with Thomson but due to lack of bookings the Alpina wasn't open and we were moved to the Kompas. Didn't have any problems during our stay. We had one of the smaller rooms without bath or balcony (you pay extra if you want those), fairly basic but comfortable, clean, with decent sized bathroom with good shower. Daily maid service. All rooms have TV with Slovenian channels, English news channels and music channels. There's no kettle in the room. Food was good, with variety throughout the week. There's a nice pool and jacuzzi. You can use the larger pool at the Hotel Larix, just over the road, free of charge. Both hotels offer spa treatments (extra charge) but we didn't use those. There's a bar and lounge area and tables, chairs and loungers outside. The location is good, just a couple of minutes to walk into the centre of Kranjska Gora, and a few minutes to the bus stop.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
lovely hotel in lovely country;5;26.02.2011;Just back from a 1 week skiing holiday booked with Crystal. Had a family room with 1 king size double and 2 single beds - it's one of the largest family rooms we've had anywhere. All nice and clean. Very friendly staff at the hotel and at the ski school. Good sized swimming pool (approx 12m long and good width). I was a bit disappointed to find out dinner was buffet style, but I needn't have worried - the food was very good and there was always plenty of choice, with the exception of desserts, which didn't vary too much. The children ate loads! The hotel is well located for the the ski school and pistes ()5mins walk). My wife and children were first time skiers, and Kranjska Gora proved to be an excellent choice, with a range of blue runs for them and very good instructors. We got lunch each day at the supermarket for less than 15 euros for the 4 of us. All in all, a great holiday!;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Good hotel, good location;4;14.02.2011;"Just spent a two week skiing holiday at this hotel. I cannot really fault anything - service, rooms, swimming pool, food and location all excellent. Perhaps the only criticism is the \sameness\"" of the dessert buffet but mains, salads, starters all very good choices available. In fact as stated we were there for two weeks and there wasn't a repeat main meal once! A word of advice - do not be fooled by your tour rep when they state that their lift pass prices are the best available - they can be obtained much cheaper at the Hotel Kompas reception desk!!""";Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
A very welcome and welcoming surprise;5;16.01.2011;Got a good deal on a week's break and went for it without knowing quite what to expect from a resort and country which were new to us. We were not disappointed!A quality of service, food and accommodation which would have justified a much higher price, a beautiful location, excellent facilities and a view from the balcony to die for. A very short walk into the quiet centre of this peaceful resort made it the perfect setting for a great relaxing short walking break and top value as well.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Great Location, great service, great value;5;11.01.2011;We stayed at the Kompas over the Christmas period travelling with Inghams and were really pleased with the whole experience. The Hotel was very clean and well kept, our room for 2 adults and 1 16 year old sharing, which we thought could pose problems was no problem at all, the room was much larger than we expected with very comfortable large beds (no sofa bed or equivalent !), there was plenty of storage and hanging space for all our needs. The room also has table and chairs, mini bar and flat screen TV with over 30 channels, a mix of Slovenian, Italian, German and English language. The bathroom was not over spacious but had a good sized shower and a very large heated towel rail, which turned out to be very handy as we had a couple of damp days. All of the staff in the reception, restaurant and bar were very helpful and willing and spoke good English amongst other languages. There is free Wi Fi available in reception and in all the rooms which worked very well.We couldn’t fault the food, the breakfast buffet was plentiful and varied and the evening meal provided a good choice to suit all the mix of nationalities staying there. Our only negative comment is that there were no“free” non alcoholic drinks provided for the evening meal. The normal, tea, coffee, chocolate, water, milk, fruit juices etc were available at breakfast but for the evening meal there was no water, or coffee available, we expected to pay for wine, beer etc but might have expected to be able to get water or coffee included as part of the meal. On Christmas eve there was a gala dinner for which some complementary drinks were provided and there was an excellent octet of local singers who provided some festive entertainment and also returned the next evening to give a free concert which was wonderful. We used the pool and spa facilities and liked the big fluffy dressing gowns and slippers they provided, although not overly large it really depended on what time you went to the pool area as to how busy it was, go at the end of a days skiing when the slopes shut and you must expect it to be busy. The ski lockers were allocated on a 1 per room basis, we would have struggled to get 3 sets of ski’s and boots etc in 1 locker and reception was kind enough to provide another locker for us.The hotel is literally 200m from the ski hire shop and the bottom of the slopes. For us the skiing was varied enough, with enough runs to keep us entertained for the week, the slopes are open 9 – 4 and there is night skiing 7-10 for 6 nights a week. There are a number of eateries and snack bars at the bottom of the slopes selling drinks and snacks, it seemed a bit hit and miss what was available depending on what time you went in though. Kranjska Gora is a lovely village and we really enjoyed the traditional, relaxed and non commercial approach to Christmas they have, it was great to get away from all the hype! There are a good number of bars and restaurants in the village to try, the bars we found especially cheap, there are also quite a few shops to wander round, market stalls and 2 well stocked supermarkets. We really enjoyed our stay at the Kompas and Kranjska Gora, we would love to go back and explore the Kranjska Gora area, the walking looks great, and the rest of Slovenia and would not hesitate to stay at the Kompas again.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Superb location for great walking. Friendly and welcoming.;4;2.09.2010;Lovely view of the mountains from our room. We stayed a week and enjoyed some great walking either directly from the hotel or by using the local buses. Good variety of food at both the breakfast and evening buffet. Our room wasn't huge but it was adequate. We enjoyed using the balcony although it didn't get direct sun. Would love to return to Kranjska Gora and the Kompas.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Clean, comfortable hotel in a convenient location;4;23.08.2010;The rooms were simple and comfortable. The hotel was conveniently situated within the resort.

Very Pleased;5;9.07.2010;Very pleased with this hotelThe food was excellent and the difficult part was choosing what to have, as there was so many choices on offer all done buffet style. We arrived back late from Venice one night and having given them notice of this a ‘salad’ was to be kept for us, this salad was way beyond our expectations. On our going home early departure a cold breakfast (packed lunch) was supplied and again it proved impressive.Great view from our room/balcony in such a peaceful location yet only a few minutes walk to the shops, cafes and supermarket. For what it’s worth the police station is just across the road although it doesn’t look like one.The indoor swimming pool is around one metre deep with lots of space to relax and there is a small kids pool. All hotel staff encountered was friendly and all in all it was a very relaxing place.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Good value, nice hotel;4;25.03.2010;We stayed on the kompas saver rate which included lift pass and ski/boot hire. It was very good value. The hotel itself was good, we had a slight problem when we arrived at 1.30pm to find our room was not made up.Once made up our room was very nice, comfy twin beds and a good size with a nice balcony for chilling our drinks. It was very warm at all times in the hotel kompas, a little over warm at times.The buffetts for breakfast and dinner had plenty of variety and although we are both vegetarian we never stuggled to find enough to eat.The kompas pool is a bit dull but you can use the Larix pool complex over the road for free and this one is much better.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877

Lovely hotel, shame about the weather!;5;12.10.2009;"Stayed in the Kompas for a week’s skiing from 28th Feb 09. The hotel was spot-on. Rooms were clean, roomy and comfortable. The food was very good indeed. I’m vegetarian and usually had a choice to tempt me on top of a good selection of salad. Breakfast was a varied buffet with the more traditional breakfast choices as well as a great array of continental goodies (my preference - being a bit of a non-typical Brit in this respect!). The bar area was pleasant enough with free WiFi but not exactly buzzing while we were there. Didn’t venture downstairs to the nightclub though…The hotel was located an easy stroll from the slopes and had secure ski lockers big enough for board and skis for two (as we ended up doing a bit of both but more on that later). The hotel had a small pool and Jacuzzi which you can use for free, but the one time we tried to use it a large family was monopolising the Jacuzzi (so we didn’t get a look in) and the pool was really too small to actually swim in unless empty (which probably only happens during the day when most people want to be on the slopes). Gave it up as a bad job after about 20 minutes before I was tempted to drown the vile children throwing themselves at me. (Disclaimer: I consider all children to be vile, almost without exception ;-)).Unfortunately we were rather unlucky with the weather. We had several days’ rain which turned the slopes to mush. Some lessons continued but conditions for skiing were pretty lousy. My instructor did his best mixing lessons with theory but my husband’s instructor (a more advanced class) called off her class for one day as she said it was too dangerous and they could easily damage their knees. We had wanted to do some boarding as we’d had an introductory class before leaving and given the conditions, this was probably just as well as the slush made for quite good beginner conditions! We booked a two hour private lesson which was just enough to get us using the lifts. Got a really good deal (two for one I think) on hiring boards (as well as the skis) for three days so spent the afternoons practicing our boarding skills (when we could face the rain). Towards the end of the week, the rain turned to snow and the temperature dropped. Conditions improved and we even got some night boarding in which was fun. Although the weather meant we didn’t get as much skiing in as I would have liked, my impression was the number of runs was quite limited. I suspect given perfect conditions, even as a low-ish intermediate skier (year three), I would have been getting bored by the end of the week. The slopes are a series of mostly quite low runs spread out side by side with some longer ones as you moved to the right (facing the slopes). Beginner and second year skiing would probably be fine with plenty of opportunity to build skills.Our last half day turned glorious. Wall-to-wall blue skies, cold with a fresh sprinkling of snow. The slopes had a whole different feel; it was Saturday so local people were out, the bars and restaurants at the bottom of the slopes had decks and terraces full of people relaxing in deck chairs in the sun and had we had a week like this I’m sure I would have come away feeling this was a perfectly nice resort – certainly for beginners. Just be aware that either end of the season can be a bit risky.One other word of warning (or recommendation, depending on your perspective!). The resort seems to be very child-friendly if the child-soup you are forced to wade through in every bar, restaurant and hotel is anything to go by. It drove me a bit mad (being a kiddie-phobe). If you are looking for a peaceful, grown-up atmosphere, this maybe isn’t the resort for you.";Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Perfect - couldn't have been better;5;25.09.2009;We booked two weeks in the Hotel Kompas on a cut-price deal, and thought that as we had paid a very low price, we would get small rooms with no views. We couldn't have been more wrong. Our room was spacious, on the second floor and with a breathtaking view across to the Julian Alps (the best view in the hotel, as far as I was concerned). The room was immaculately cleaned every day and was very comfortable, with a lovely balcony. The buffet-style evening meal was ideal, as there was a lot of choice and you could have as much or as little as you wanted.The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and couldn't do enough for us. They also spoke excellent English.The pool was a little on the small side, but it was fine if there were not too many people in there.The location of the hotel was the best in Kranjska Gora. Set in its own grounds with lots of trees, it was very close to the village centre with its restaurants and bars, but far enough away not to be disturbed by noise.I would certainly return to this very welcoming hotel.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
good break;5;3.09.2009;Part of a large chain of hotels in the village, on the outskirts but close to the ski lifts and 5 minutes walk to the centre, The hotel is starting to show its age, but first impressions were good, reception staff are very helpful , full of information and speak English.Rooms are basic but cover everything you require, bathroom is a good size , shower , hot water is hit and miss, depending on how many in the hotel, one problem there is no air conditioning is, and carpets on all floors, very hot on a night time in August, No Kettle so take your own, TV has 40 channels and in house films etc, you can also check your bill each day, Free safe in the room which is handy, cleaning staff were great , extras towels if needed etc.Restaurant was a good size, plenty of choice for all courses, meats are a bit bland, but enjoyable, watch your timings if large groups of tourist coaches or sports teams are booked in, adjust your timings to miss them, otherwise watch the floor show on are to clear a buffet in a short time, although food was quickly stocked up again,One small bar in reception, not very nice to sit around, although the day the Terrence is a good area to sit.Swimming pool was great and a small sun area just outside, used every day,Overall a good pleasant week was had, and enjoyed the stay, used all 5 hotels in the chain each night for entertainment and will be going back;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877

Choice of food at breakfast and evening meal outstanding, and well presented. Staff friendly and hotel's own programme good with organised walks, shuttle bus to other hotels and children's activities.

nice hotel;4;29.05.2009;I went here for a business meeting, so I didn't ski. I liked the food, buffet breakfast and dinner. The room was cosy and clean.

Excellent, family friendly hotel;5;3.05.2009;We stayed in this hotel for a week in January with 3 children aged 2,9 & 12. Our room was plenty big enough with loads of storage for all the essential ski kit and baby gear. Also had locked ski lockers down stairs. This is a fantastic hotel in the heart of the village. The only problem was the snobbery in the restaurant which wasn't really meant for a 2 year just learning to feed himself!! Also we were surprsied to find although there were dressing gowns, slippers, hairdryers etc in the rooms there was no kettle - which was a bit of a pain, especially as we drink gallons of tea!The ski facilities are excellent and cater for everyone, lots of easy learner slopes and a few more difficult blacks (note the reds are marked up as reds but in France these would actually be blacks and the some of the blues are really reds. There are no greens - if you know what I mean).The swimming pools was lovely and you can use the other pools at the other hotels for free. There is also a playroom for under 5's which isn't brilliant but its somewhere to burn off a bit of energy.The food was lovely (buffet style) with plenty of choice for all and amazing puddings!!;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Outstanding value for money;5;16.03.2009;Just been skiing at Kranjska Gora 7-14 Mar 09, stayed at Kompas. Booked THE cheapest ski hol on-line I could find and this place was it, so was apprehensive about accommodation and resort as a whole, however there was no need whatsoever. Have paid twice as much to ski in France, etc with accommodation only half as good. Kompas was clean, rooms very large & well furnished/presented, double bed extremely comfortable, (altho for some reason we had 2 single duvets all week rather than one double??!) Only poor comment is our room smelt of cigarattes (not entirely hotel's fault) and of 'drains' the whole stay! But apart from that it was superb - fantastic view onto mountains, staff great and food amazing - as much as you want to eat buffet style and we did not have a bad breakfast or eve meal in all 7 days. Prices not bad either for drinks. Would def recommend hotel to anyone, families, singles or couples. Lots of children there but did not matter. Whole resort totally perfect for beginners and 2nd/3rd time ski but not so good for advanced ski as limited runs. Pretty village. Can recom the waffles in the village, small cafe opposite supermarket!;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Lovely Hotel;5;14.03.2009;i have just returned from the hotel kompas (7th -14th march 09) on my first skiing holiday! even know after 3days of ski lessons i decided skiing wasnt for me it did not change my refletion of hotel kompas or the resort of kranjska gora. the food is great esp evening meals! the only negative i would say is there is not much for english people at breakfast unless ur european and like olives cheese etc (not for me at 7am !!) .the rooms are very nice and clean and chambermaids r lovely! kompas has a good swimming pool and steam rooms etc but be aware unlike in england steam rooms etc (apart from pool) are naked only so not for the shy!! but nobody bats an eyelid.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Magical Experience and would go back in a heartbeat!!!;5;8.02.2009;We stayed in Hotel Kompas from 17-24th January 2009. We are a family of 4, 2 adults and 2 children and we had never skied before. We we pleasently surprised when we arrived at the hotel at 8.30pm as there were people sitting around in the comfy sofas and some were dancing to music. We were given our keys and headed to our room. The room was very clean and spacious for a family of 4, though we found our bed to be very hard. We had just missed dinner so the hotel laid on a cold dinner straight away. The food in the resturant was very good and we found that we were going up for seconds, they did have some food for the children.The only fault that we would have is that some of the women waiters in the resturant and bar were very ignorant and that did make me think that surely they should treat tourists with respect as afterall we are bringing money into their economy.We found the hotel to be very close to the slopes, and the town was very quaint and homely. This is a very cheap holiday as their prices in the bar were very reasonable as a glass of red wine was 1.20 euros and a large beer was 2 euros. The supermarket down the street was cheep as well as we bought water for 14 cents and coke etc for 77 cents, cigarettes 2 euros.Our Ski Instructor Emir was very good and made this experience the best. We would come back to this hotel in a heartbeat as it is good value and close to everything. The resort has limited shops and bars but we found that there was enough for us. We met some wonderful people in our ski group and we have stayed intouch. When Our coach came to pick us up there were tears in our eyes as we had enjoyed it so much. My kids our talking about next year even before we had left the resort. We do hope to met up with the new friends next year at the same place.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Kranj Fan;5;15.01.2009;Have been a yearly visitor to Kranj for the past 5/6yrs and have always stayed at the Larix. Last year was my first year bringing non skier wife and 2 kids (6yrs and 9mth old!) and booked the Kompas Hotel. I cannot be complimentary enough about our experience. Our arrival was late (2am), yet the night staff had a cold supper ready for us (all we wanted was bed!). Room was perfect (large double, a single, huge cot for baby and loads of space). Noticed a rather unpleasant odour (drain smell) in bathroom but fell into bed. Next morning smell still there, went to reception and within 20mins had been moved next door no fuss! Half board and food was superb (much better than Larix where could be a bit hit/miss). Very fussy eater son ate better than at home. Staff very friendly and kept playing with the baby. Great Location, nice pool (smaller than Larix but less crowded so more pleasant). very positive experience and highly recommend this hotel. Unfortunately this year could not get the Kompas (mid-term) so will be in Alpina. Although it appears fine will be hard pushed imho to match last years experience at Kompas. BTW Kranj fantastic for families with young kids, also beginners. Not alot of variety for advanced (me a bit bored with skiing options but going for kids benefit) just beware it is a low resort and snow reliability can be iffy!;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
loved it xxx;5;7.12.2008;was staying at the hotel kompas with my husband and 2 children for a ski holiday. hotel was excellent just across the road from the slopes. staff very friendly.food in the hotel was quite traditional, but i am a fussy eater and i always found something nice to eat. rooms lovely good size for a family of four. intersport bernik ski schools fantastic staff brilliant with children.hotel at night is quiet everyone seems to just sit around on the comfy sofas in the lobby with the log fire going.a couple of other hotels have more entertainment but we where so tired after day skiing and night skiing lounging in front of the fire a must!prices very good everything very cheap compared with other ski resorts i have been.loved it so much going back in january 2008 same hotel xxxx;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
A great hotel in a lovely location;5;30.07.2008;Having seen the Julian Alps from our flight into Ljubljana, we were really looking forward to our week at the Hotel Kompas, and we certainly weren’t disappointed with what we found there. We had paid a bit extra to upgrade to a superior mountain-view room and were so glad that we did as the view from our balcony was stunning. The room itself was a good size and we were really pleased that the satellite TV channels included BBC World as we like to keep up with the news while we are away. We stayed on a half board basis and found the hotel food was generally excellent as was the service. We only drank in the hotel bar once as the centre of Kranjska Gora is only a few mins walk away with a good selection of much cheaper bars. It is also near the supermarket which is great for stocking up on drinks and picnic food (they sell rolls on the deli counter). We can also recommend Café Charlie near the hotel for ice-creams and strudel, Hotel Kotnik and Pension Lipa for pizzas and Kala for cakes and fruit pies (behind Pension Lipa, near the bus station).In terms of the facilities, the Kompas has a small pool and Jacuzzi, a godsend after a hard day of walking and sightseeing, and you can also use the swimming pool complex at the nearby hotel Larix. We only went on one organised trip with Inghams – to Ljubljana. It cost 33 Euros each – which is not cheap considering you only get a few hours there, but it is a 4 hr round trip by local bus so it’s definitely a convenient way to see the capital. We would recommend a trip up to the castle by funicular for a great view of the city.We spent the rest of our time doing walks in and around Kranjska Gora – the scenery is absolutely stunning. You can get a walking map in English from the Tourist Office which tells you the length and difficulty of the suggested walks. We found that the descriptions often underestimated the nature of the walks though and after a couple of hairy experiences, we decided to stick to easy walks for the remainder of our time. In particular, the summit walk from the top of the summer chair lift in Kranjska Gora has sections where you really have to scramble up on your hands and knees – definitely take walking poles if you can and watch out for swift changes in the weather. A lot of the walks start in Kranjska Gora, but if you want to go further afield then there are plenty of local buses (more during the week than at weekends) – you can even get a direct bus to Lake Bled once a day. Also bear in mind that the summer season doesn’t officially begin until mid June – there are more activities on offer during the season and the chairlifts and summer toboggan run (highly recommended) run during the week as well as at weekends. We had an absolutely great holiday overall and wouldn’t hesitate to recommend both the Kompas and Kranjska Gora itself.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Disappointed;3;22.06.2008;We travelled to Kranjska Gora and the hotel Kompas from Rovinj in Croatia for the second week of our holiday. We expected to find the same friendly people in Slovenia as on our previous week. However, this was not to be. On our first night we arrived at the dining room expecting a warm greeting. Instead we received a grunt from the lady who appeared to be in charge. She took us to our table and mumbled this is where you will have dinner and breakfast for the next week. The small tables are in very close proximity to each other but fortunately we sat next to a very friendly couple. It would have been very easy to have been less fortunate. The general feeling of unfriendliness continued from a number but not all of the staff.On looking round the dining room we noticed a large number of wall lights were not working. A quick count showed that 34 out of 96 were in this condition. This did improve as about a third of the bulbs were replaced before we left. The tables in the dining room were left uncleared for a considerable time after the guests had left their table, but we think this was because of insufficient staff. We feel that this is unacceptable in a supposedly four star hotel. Our room was very good , as was the ensuite, with beautiful views of the mountains. The swimming pool area was excellent.There didn't appear to be anyone who could be identified as a Manager, certainly no one out and about the hotel making sure the operation ran smoothly.We had read lots of comments about how good the walking is around Kranjska Gora but in our opinion because the area is so heavily wooded it made no difference as to what walk you were on as you could not see much of the scenery. There were a few exceptions to this where you did see the mountains and these were indeed spectacular.The very centre of Kranjska Gora is attractive but for a small mountain village we feel that two 24 hour casinos are not appropriate.We had considered a holiday in Kranjska Gora for a number of years but we will not be returning.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Absolutely brilliant!;5;27.02.2008;"My partner and I have just returned from Kransjka Gora on our first snowboarding holiday (2-9 Feb 08) and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We chose the Kompas Hotel as it had pool and relaxation area. We arrived on the Saturday when the \Ski Legends\"" event was taking place and the hotel reception area was packed with lots of old (and rude) people and we had wondered on our choice of hotel but it was only busy because of the event and it finished that evening so the hotel quietened down - phew!The hotel staff were friendly, polite and helpful although unfortunately we had to wait until 3pm to get into our room as we think they were a little short staffed (we arrived at the hotel around 10am). But this did not dampen our spirits, we took a walk around the town to get our bearings, viewed the slopes and picked up our board and boots - the shop was very busy but this is to be expected as everyone on our flight wanted to pick up their hire gear. Oh, when we arrived to pick up our hire gear, First Choice told us we needed photos for the ski passes - we did not have these so we paid 2 euros each to have our photo taken, not the end of the world but maybe some people would like to take their own picture, apparently a copy of your passport picture is good enough. The hotel will give you a locker (downstairs) for all your hire gear too, at a deposit of 5 euros. The food in the restaurant was very good, there was always a good selection of evening meals with soups, breads, hot dishes, salads, cold meats, cheese, desserts and ice cream. The breakfast was also of a good selection, you can have a hot breakfast or a cold one and even a healthy one as there is a table offering healthy options of seeds and muesli. The drinks we purchased with our dinner were reasonably priced and in fact, so was the mini bar in our room which is nice as these are almost always overpriced. Which leads me nicely to our room. Before arriving, we were of the understanding that none of the rooms had a bath which disappointed us somewhat as we were looking forward to a warm bath after being out on the slopes all day (we only have a shower at home so a bath for us is real treat!). We were given room 138 and we have to say, it was perfect AND it had a bath!! The room was a very generous size, the bathroom was large, the wardrobe/dressing area were spacious and we had a table and chair/sitting area. Our balcony overlooked the slopes too. The room was clean and two apples awaited our arrival. Our room was cleaned every day and we felt it was done to a very high standard. No complaints there. The smoking ban came into play in Slovenia in July (ish) of last year so the hotel was smoke free and so are all the restaurants and pubs - which was great.The pool & Jacuzzi were fine and the staff there were very helpful and friendly. Be aware that these areas became very busy from around 4.30pm until dinner - this is because the slopes close at 4pm every day (they open at 9am). The relaxation area was brilliant. We paid 5.50 euros each for a session in there. There are two saunas, a steam room, showers, plunge pool and a relaxation area with lovely wooden seats that rocked back and forwards. We used this on a number of occasions. The lockers are free.There had not been any snow since Nov but on arrival, it snowed for us for two whole days which was perfect! Even when it did not snow, they used the snow cannons a few times which produced a nice sugary snow effect. A few mornings the slopes were very icy but by about 11am, they had softened up.We booked snowboarding lessons with our tour operator (First Choice). These were every morning at 9am for 2 hours. On Sunday, the lesson started at midday. We were in a group of 9 and we had two instructors - Luca and Blush who both worked for Bernik Intersport - their \""office\"" was at the bottom of the slope, at the back of the Larix Hotel. Both instructors were brilliant. Luca has been snowboarding for 10 years and we did book one private lesson with him and we have to say, he is an excellent teacher! Our private lesson for one hour was 24 euros.So, the slopes opened 9am-4pm, after which they were \""groomed\"" ready for the next day. The night skiing started at 8pm - 10pm although not on a Monday. We spent most of our time on the nursery slopes which did get a little busy but this did not really bother us, as we were all learners. We have to say, when queueing for the \""buttons\"" the queue seemed to be a little messy to say the least - being English, we joined the back of the queue each time, expecting everyone to then join after us but that is not the case at all! People just shuffled in where and when they felt like it, there is no orderly queue so by the end of the week, we had become like everyone else - not caring about pushing in. Which is a shame really, it's not nice to have to battle your way in the queue - the kids are the worst too, they seem to think they have a right to shuffle past you to the front of the queue. If you are in a group lesson (as we were) the instructors will make sure you get through the queue together.There are only a handful of restaurants and bars in this resort, so if you are looking for a full-on party apres-ski, you may be disappointed. We tried two of the pizza restaurants which were both delicious. We tried a few of the bars, the Grand Prisank bar was good with some pool tables the Bar Inca, run by Jay (who is English) was fantastic with a great selection of drinks and cocktails and Jay, who is very friendly - we recommend this bar!We did not go to the nightclub in our hotel. To be honest, after a day on the slopes, all we could manage to do was have a sauna, dinner and then veg in our room watching TV!The little cafe/bars at the bottom of all the slopes serve lunch and drinks - try a few as they are all different, ranging from burger and chips to traditional meats and soups.We found the resort to be just what we needed and very good value for money. We were very, very pleased with our holiday.""";Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Room for improvement;3;16.02.2008;I stayed at the Kompass as part of an all-female skiing group. Three of us are vegetarian and regrettably, for an allegedly Four Star Hotel, the chefs did not seem to be well acquainted with a meat-free lifestyle. Even carnivorous group members struggled with the uninspiring food on offer to guests via the buffet-style arrangements.My room faced the mountain, great during the day, when I was actually on it-skiing, but horrendous at night, when the snow cannons started up at three in the morning - every morning. This shouldn't be a problem if it actually snows when you're staying there.However, don't be put off....staff were generally very helpful and moved one of the party to the other side of the hotel when she couldn't take any more night time noise. Rooms are very clean and if you're looking for the ideal beginner's ski resort, this is definitely it.Enjoy!;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Rude staff;1;7.02.2008;We stayed for a week halfboard, the food is edible but really not great, we found several of the waiters to be quite rude. The hotel is spotless and the chambermaids do a great job. Rooms are on the small side and compared to other hotels we have stayed at in Slovenia the Kompas is very disappointing. Reception staff are very rude and unhelpful. They lost our key and then tried to insist that we had never left it with them when going out. They spoke about us as though we were not there while they were looking for our key for a third time. When they finally found the key they did not apologise for the mistake or their rudeness. Staff at the Larix across the road seem to be much nicer, it also looks like a nicer hotel.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
no hassle hotel;4;22.10.2007;Stayed at the Kompas on business, the little village of Kranjska Gora appears to mainly be a small family style ski resort but being October was very quiet.The hotel itself didn't have much personality but was very practical with my room on the small size but equipped with all the normal services, satelitte TV and mini bar (very reasonable prices), it also had free wireless internet connection which was a great change and no hassle to set up! The room was very clean, as was the hotel. The resturant was buffet style and had a wide selection of everything you would want / expect for all meals which again was good but there was nothing I'd call special about any of it, however, don't get me wrong, I've no complaints either.The hotel was located within the village, just a short walk to the centre where there's a small range of shops, bars and resturants. The ski lifts were in close proximity of the hotel too and whilst it started snowing while there, this wasn't enough to get the lifts open for skiing.The hotel pool was on the small size and pretty limited but I'd strongly recommend you go over to the pool facitlites at the Hotel Larix, 2 mins walk away, a sister hotel and the facilities are free. Their pool was first class and catered for all levels of recreational swimmer be it swimming lengths, sitting in the hot tub or just splashing about and relaxing. I used it twice, having the whole pool to myself at 9.30 an a sunday morning.Overall, a very practical hotel that provided a functional service, if skiing it would be ideal, as a romantic break, probaby not.Would I go back, yes, with the family for a short skiing holiday.;Hotel Kompas;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelKompas;Borovshka cesta 100 ,Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.486198;13.7799877
Unknown Slovenia;5;7.10.2007;We were four retired persons who hardly knew where Slovenia was but we certainly know now and would recommend it to anybody of all ages. We stayed at the Hotel Kompass in Kranjska Gora - it was superb. The rooms were excellent, we had a balcony and mountain view. Our table in the dining room was reserved for the whole week and the food catered for all tastes. All the staff were friendly and helpful. Kranjska Gora and the surrounding villages are very pretty and easy to walk to. The four of us even did the toboggan run. This is one place we would all return to. R.

Enjoyable stay - excellent location;4;4.06.2017;We stayed here from Saturday 26 May for a week and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves in Kranjska Gora. The hotel is well situated being only a few minutes walk from the centre of town and in a quiet location. The hotel has a beautiful view of the mountains.Our room with a west facing balcony was perfect for enjoying the evening sunshine and was quite spacious for a table and two chairs.The room was a good size, plenty of space for storing/hanging clothes etc, small fridge, tv etc. The beds were very comfortable and everything was clean. great shower pressure and plenty of hot water.

Friendly family environment;3;25.04.2017;The room was spacious, plenty of storage for hanging bulky winter clothes, in our case walking gear. The shower caused a few problems but was sorted immediately once reported, which was excellent. All staff were very helpful and polite. All meals were self service, the great thing was that you could choose a combination of foods to suit your diet and appetite and plenty of choice, children friendly too. Small café/bar in the basement that served good snacks and drinks at lunchtime also open in the evening.The location was perfect for us, lots of walks clearly signposted but also easy to miss a turn off as we experienced, but all part of the fun. From the hotel you can walk to Jasna, beautiful frozen lake and exceptional scenery(as is everywhere) Short walk into the centre of Kranjska Gora, shops with all the basic things one would need, lots of cheap clothing and other specialist shops. Found a lovely yummy cake shop but not so keen on the very thick milkshakes,a bit like custard! Bus routes are clear and seem to take you almost anywhere, also good information centre. We caught a bus to Sloveniski planiski muze ( the Slovenian Alpine Museum) beautiful village, the museum was great, loads of history on mountain climbers and interactive experiences which would be good for children. Visited Bled castle - excellent. Visited Ljubljana capital of Slovenia, tour around the old city, loved it, so much history. We also found the tallest residential old building with a glass café and restaurant at the top, amazing views, worth a visit - great coffee and cake as a reward!! as you do have to go in an old lift to the top! passing many floors. If you are fit you could probably walk, we walked down! it was great experience. Our final visit was to Postojnska Jama, where we visited the caves, so impressive, just incredible.

Disappointing and in need of refurbishment.;3;15.03.2017;We selected the Lek based on all the positive reviews, unfortunately I think that we must have checked into a Lek in a parallel universe! It is true that the staff are very friendly and helpful, and the hotel is well located, however, the hotel is in need of refurbishment! The decor of the rooms, dinning room and bar are very dated and well worn, carpets stained and furniture scruffy. We didn't use the pool therefore unable to comment. To be fare and to the staff's credit they succeed in keeping the place clean, and the linen & towels are also clean, but in need of replacing. Most disappointedly was the buffet style food, it was terrible, we never had a hot meal, at best it was lukewarm and often stone cold, we tried being first in the restaurant but it was just as bad. As an example the bacon at breakfast was cold and swimming in fat! At best this is only a 3 star hotel. Interestingly, we were told by some of the staff that the hotel has been sold and there are plans being drawn up for modernisation, we did see evidence of people measuring and management discussing various areas in the hotel. One final point, again staff told us that some of their colleagues had left because of the impending changes, but this is only rumour!;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Excellent stay;5;4.03.2017;Very warm welcome from all of the staff, spotlessly clean everywhere. Breakfast and evening buffet amazing value with good quality and great choice. Free ski lockers downstairs is a great feature and its a 10 min maximum walk to the slopes. Recommend the Coffee shop. Superior room was spacious with a very comfortable bed and great views. Decor may be a bit dated but the other positives more than outweigh this. British visitors in particular may wish to bring a kettle and tea bags as there isnt one in the room. Hotel has apparently been sold and we hope the new owners dont sacrifice any of the charm of the place.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Lovely Hotel;4;26.02.2017;We stayed across half term for a family ski holiday. The hotel was overall excellent. Food was good, rooms clean, pool excellent. Negatives, we had the cheapest rooms, which were fine, apart from only having skylights. We would defiantly stay again. They do need to drop the €2 charge for tap water though it's an unfair charge in our opinion.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594

Family skiing trip for one week. ;4;20.02.2017;We were a family group of six which included my three teenage boys. We had a very enjoyable stay in Hotel Lek and an excellent skiing holiday in Kranska Gora. We found the staff in the hotel friendly and helpful and the rooms very clean and spacious. We enjoyed the swimming pool and jacuzzi several evenings after skiing. Most importantly for the teenagers the free wifi connection was strong. We had breakfast and dinner in the hotel which were in a buffet style of several hot dishes, lots of bread & fruit always and a good salad bar in the evening as well as a choice of soups. The pancakes at breakfast were always popular. Everybody in our family found food that they liked except on one night. We were there for Valentines Day and the hotel made big efforts with decorating the table in the theme and a love heart shaped cake for pudding. My only critical comments are that the orange juice in the morning was more like orange squash and we had to pay 1€ for a jug of tap water. The hotel provides a locker in the ski room for gear and it is an easy walk from there to the ski slopes with ski boots on. We would definitely stay at Hotel Lek again if we were in Kranska Gora. ;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Ski holiday;4;18.02.2017;Very high quality accommodation, containing: Good food, great accommodation, fantastic facilities. Although lacks some minuscule finishing touches, as personally I find the hotel slightly outdated mundane and in need of a touch up, and I feel alike the gym is moderately lacklustre. But over all would highly recommend visiting. Staff are very friendly and are always there to help, offering fantastic services and immense gluten free food. Over all due to the fantastic atmosphere and quality of service, I'd give this four stars.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Great value for money;4;13.02.2017;We booked our holiday through Balkan holidays. The price we paid we weren't expecting a such a nice hotel. The pools were very nice indeed as was the hot tub.The gym and sauna were nice too. I had a massage one day and thought how good it was. The overall condition of the hotel is very good. We had a superior room on the ground floor with a balcony. The room was very nice we had a door from the bedroom to a hallway before the door to the room so it stopped any noise. The shower pressure was the best I have ever come across it was like having a massage.All of the staff were very polite and friendly. The food was excellent a really good choice every night. I really don't know how they do it for the price. it was just a short walk to the slopes and the skiing is ideal for families and beginner's. The restaurant wine prices were very reasonable as well. I would thoroughly recommend the hotel and the area surrounding it. well done to all the staff.Hope to visit again.Steve;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Fabulous!!!;5;5.02.2017;Great Hotel with friendly staff, good food and excellent accommodation ( we were on the ground floor). Quite location but only a 5 minute walk to the ski school. Not the place to stay if you want a lively bar, which was perfect for our group as we're not party people. .

Last minute ski break that did not disappointed.;4;29.01.2017;Clean, comfortable hotel with very pleasant staff. Free WiFi throughout. Good pool and spa facilities.

Nice location;4;27.01.2017;Spring or winter, location and amenities of the hotel will make your stay pleasant. Nice hotel with quiet rooms and helpfull staff. Large swimming pool and good restaurant.

Improvements required;3;15.01.2017;"The reason we went to this hotel was because we had seen it was for sale and we wondered if it might suit us. So we booked in for a couple of nights to find out.It has all the basic ingredients but really does need some \elevation\"" all around.Let's start with the staff; in general they were pleasant and helpful but seemed to suffer from a local trait - they do not know how to smile and this is rather off putting. The downstairs bar was not very well manned; the staff seemed to come and go somewhat and I have to say that the bar was really inadequate for a 72 room hotel.The food was not really very enterprising. The basic problem is that this is a \""family hotel\"" with kids running around and screaming everywhere. So the food tended to be \""kids' food\"" rather than quality food expected of a 4 star hotel for adults. The meals were all buffet style and it was a bit like a scrum getting your food. And with children migrating in and out and in and out and in and out the whole time it was very disruptive. At least they gave us a table as far away from the madding crowd as possible!As regards \""style\"", when we went into the dining room, properly dressed as we felt, heads turned. Everyone else was in track suits, trainers, tea shirts etc etc. No one really had any respect for the dining room.Little things like ugly electric wires dangling around let the place down badly. It just looks rather shabby.The room was not too bad. No tea making equipment or anything like that and probably more 3 star than 4, as was the whole place.And then there was a wellness centre with a lovely swimming pool. Guess what. You had to pay extra for that! Unbelievable.I would not stay there again as it is not the style I would want to try and relax in and the prospect of paying extra for part of the hotel's standard services is wholly alien to me.If you want a cheap package deal this is probably okay for you.We understand the hotel is now sold; we wish the buyers good luck - they will need it.""";Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Friendly and comfortable ;4;18.10.2016;Stayed here for a two week business trip and the place is nice and clean, very welcoming and comfortable.

Lovely Holiday;4;26.09.2016;Just arrived back from a weeks holiday at Hotel Lek found staff very welcoming and friendly. The room we had was at the top front of the hotel and this commanded a long balcony with good views of the small river and mountains. The room was spacious and clean but it did have a beam which was at such an angle that you had to watch your head when sitting on the couch. The only thing that did spoil things was that being at the end of the season the bar was not always manned and we did even walk away once as we waited for 5 minutes for someone to come and serve us. Food was ok although it was only warm at breakfast. It was very quiet also in and around Kranska Gora and the cable cars were only working on Friday, Saturday and Sunday (weather permitting). Slovenia is a beautiful country and would recommend this as a holiday for people who love the open spaces and it does have good walkways/cycle paths. I hope to visit sometime again in the not too distant future.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Great hotel and a pool with a view;5;25.09.2016;We enjoyed our 2 weeks at Hotel Lek and feel we definitely made the right choice. Although Kranjska Gora isn't exactly a large noisy place it was nice being towards the edge of the town but with only a 5 minute walk into the centre (and only a short walk to the beautiful Jasna lake.) We had had concerns that rooms at the front might suffer from road noise but it really wasn't a problem even with the windows open at night. The staff were friendly and helpful and the room was good. The pool was never overly busy and had wonderful views out to the mountains.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Great location for walkers;5;19.09.2016;Hotel Lek is a 5 minute walk into Kranska Gora. The town is not big but has everything that we wanted. There is one main bus stop. Buses go everywhere. Timetable from tourist office.Room 4. Superior room with balcony and lovely geraniums the national flower of Slovenia in boxes. The room has views to the Alps and there is a main road but very little noise. Room has the following facilities.Safe, toiletries, shower over bath, hairdryer, and fridge.There is no air conditioning which was a shame as our week in Kranska was unseasonably warm for September.There are no tea/coffee making facilities in room. We always take a travel kettle etc. Beds comfy. Maid service very good . She even noticed that I required another pillow. The staff are very friendly . Especially Jadran (Adrian) who has worked at the hotel for the past 25 years and Gose.Breakfast and dinner are buffet style. The dining room suffers from random pillars so negotiating around them is fun.There is a pool, sauna and beauty salon. However as we are walkers and the weather was great we did not avail of them. Free WiFi for those who need it.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Lovely hotel;4;14.09.2016;The important things. Beer is 2.70 Euros a bottle. No draught. The local supermarket, Mercator, is a 5 minute walk. Open to 20:00 Mon - Sat and 08:00- 12:00 on Sunday, despite what it says on their website. My room had a fridge in it and was fine. Plenty of bars in town.As a veggie this place is fine as meals are self service. The soups were very good, and I managed to eat every evening. Good salad selection and choice of puddings. Ratatouille for breakfast took a bit of getting used to.Good swimming pool and hot whirlpool.Would definitely stay here again if back in town.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Very friendly and helpful staff;3;10.09.2016;The Lek is just a little run down and (as the title implies) the invariably helpful staff are its greatest asset but it also bosts an excellent pool with whirlpool and other accessories. My twin room would have been very small for two but was fine as a single - the superior rooms were really excellent. The food (self-service, eat as much as you like) was nothing to write home about - nor to grumble at. Just out of the (small) town I'd rate it's location as excellent.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
A great hotel in an amazing location;5;18.08.2016;We were really pleased with the Lek as a base for our summer walking and running adventure in the Alps. The hotel is in overall good repair and décor. As a summer base it is in a vary good location in easy reach of the mountains and the little town of Kranjska Gora.We stayed half-board and both breakfast and dinner were buffet style with plenty of choice. We were quite happy with the food, the highlights for us were the cold starters, where there was always something surprising and the excellent cakes (this is Slovenia so it would have been pretty disappointing if the cakes weren’t any good). The Hotel’s café-bar with a seating area outside was a great place for us to relax in the afternoon drinking Laško beer after a hard morning on the mountain.The Hotel has an excellent indoor pool which we liked because it was an even depth and long enough to swim which is a great after a long walk! There are also tennis courts (although we never got round to using them).As far as the town and surrounding area is concerned is it absolutely stunning and gets five-stars as a location. The town itself is small enough to be intimate yet it has all the modern facilities and is a very neat and tidy place. There is a modern “proper” supermarket (i.e. not a tourist one) and a plethora of restaurants, bars and cake shops. The tourist information office is modern and helpful, co-located with a café bar! The Italian influence means you can get a very good Pizza for lunch and it is fantastic value for money – one pizza is enough for two and its acceptable and the “done thing” to share.The surrounding area is a walkers and cyclists’ paradise. Walkers have access to a range of numbered well-marked paths through the mountains and they range from easy strolls through the alpine meadows to the much more challenging routes for which you need a head for heights. Each route is rated according to difficulty and the maps are available at the tourist information office. For cyclists, there are some great flat cycle paths going through the valleys following on disused railway lines. If you are a more adventurous cyclist, you can climb the famous Vršiè Pass, which is about 6 miles of road, climbing about 800 metres but with fantastic views when you get to the top.For the mad, you can take your BMX bike up the chairlift (designed for skiers) and come down the specially prepared course which has humps, jumps and everything!Kranjska Gora is very close to the border with Italy and Austria and it is quite possible to do a day’s walk or cycle ride taking in all three countries. About 1 mile from the Lek hotel is the little lake of Jasna which is a lovely spot and if you are really brave you can take a dip in the icy cold water.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
friendly and efficient;5;15.08.2016;We visited on a last minute holiday and were surprised at the hotel, resort and service. A superb hotel, though we did have to upgrade as our room was too small.

How good is Slovenia;3;12.08.2016;Slovinian is such a buetiful country We stayed at Hotel Lek Kranjaska Gora (3rd to 10th Aurgest 2016) from there the walks are wonderful, bus service is very good , (do not rely on torice bus) . Hotel Lek! Room perfectly Ok Breakfast very good, Even meal a bit repetitive but we always had an adequate meal. Negative is that on our last night we were asked to leave the bar at 2200hrs because we were the only customers which imply there want to make money rater than costumer satisfaction. I could not get over how clean Slovenia is , no rubbish anywhere .;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Love Slovinia;5;30.07.2016;We stayed at Hotel Lek in Kranjaska Gora for 2 weeks from 29th June. We had a superior room, no 15 which had lots of storage space,a lovley modern bathroom and a decent size bedroom with tv and fridge. We also had a lovely balcony overlooking the mountains. The hotel was spotless and all the staff were very friendly. The food was decent. Plenty choice at breakfast and the evening meal which is buffet however soups and main course is served to you rather than serve yourself On 1 or 2 nights my choice of salmon and turkry kebab on another night was a bit disappointing as it was very dry otherwise everything was good. We had an amazing holiday and would definitely return to Hotel Lek.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Very enjoyable stay;4;9.07.2016;Stayed at Hotel Lek in June it was in walking distance of the town and we choose it because it had tennis courts , in fact the tennis course are not part of the hotel but adjacent but you can pay and use. Very clean . We were given one room on arrival but we had upgrade con booking and asked tp change. We got another room which was bigger and brighter on the downside it had no bath , welcome after a hard days walking and the view wasn't as good. But otherwise happy with choice . Food was ok , we ate out 2 nights as food nothing to rave about;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Beautiful Hotel Must go Back !;5;10.06.2016;A friendly and entirely professional experience. Great choice of food, restaurant lovely, standard room just right.Mountain views superb from front of the hotel and river and waterfall across the road. follow the river to the right of the hotel 15 minutes walk on slight incline to the lovely Jasna lake with it's turquoise water and stunning mountains tree covered slopes. Take a chairlift up the mountain to see the meadow flowers and beauatiful views of the next village. Don't miss the sound of the cow bells clanging. Enjoy a wonderful A la Carte lunch at Bor restaurant or choose an ice cream at Charlie's. A peaceful village to wander around with many cafes and bars, opportunities to hire cycles and book water rafting, buy sports clothing or browse for souvenirs to take home. Weather in May warm but changeable. Good for walking and as a base for excursions to pictuesque Bled and Bohinj lakes -not forgetting Bled cream cake!

Great Alpine Hotel- even out of season;5;4.05.2016;I love the Lek. I've been twice now and it ticks all the boxes. Typical Alpine lodge decor, comfortable rooms, good facilities, amazing food and super friendly staff- exactly what you want when staying in the Julian Alps. Its also very popular with Slovenian people who tell us they always stay there, which speaks volumes over the other hotels locally.If I'm going to be super critical then some of the building is tired- it needs a bit of investment and a lick of paint here and there... but the friendliness of the staff and the quality and quantity of the food and drink more than make up for this.There is plenty of parking (I would recommend hiring a car when staying anywhere in Slovenia) and the location in the town is excellent- a few minutes from the town centre, but away from the main drag. The view of the mountains is superb from most parts of the hotel, you can even sit in their lovely warm Jacuzzi and look at the snowy peak of Triglav.If anything I'm surprised that this hotel isn't more popular with British tourists. You are so well looked after, its impossible to go hungry and its very comfortable.Thanks for a great stay- we will be back!;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
First ski trip with children;4;20.04.2016;"We booked this hotel as part of a package through Baltic Holidays, for February half term skiing holiday.Good points:Only about a 7 minute walk in ski gear (with easily distracted 5 and 8 year olds) in nursery slope; excellent restaurant staff who were so friendly and charming; buffet meals serving Slovenian and European food; good stews, salads and sweets/puddings; leisure club (pools, indoor hot tub etc); 10 minute walk to old part of town; not too big. Less good points: slightly dated bedrooms (compared to UK), but still very clean and absolutely fine within our price bracket - pretty typical of Europe; breakfasts not quite as good as suppers, but still loads of choice. Probably very good for a summer stay.Kranjska Gora is a lovely small town. The main plus point is it's only 50 minutes transfer from Lubjiana airport. It is quite low (compared to mainstream ski resorts in France, Switzerland, and Austria) but is fantastic for young families provided there is snow: the ski areas are not so large that you get lost. If you are a good experienced skier, you'll probably get bored after a 3 days. But to take children to, it's ideal. Quite reasonably priced. Ski lift passes can be done half daily, daily weekly etc, so plenty of flexibility. We will definitely return.";Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Fairly basic but decent meal after skiing, good beers and friendly staff;4;22.03.2016;We visited this hotel in February with my partner, my mum and my 1 year old daughter. We wanted a hotel that was half board and had a buffet style menu to accommodate a fussy one year old. We also wanted something close to the town and of course the ski slopes but that was large enough to keep my mum and daughter entertained when we went skiing. This hotel has a brilliant swimming area with 3 pools which kept them entertained in the afternoon. It also had several different lounge areas where they could sit and read or play games or crawling space. The staff were absolutely lovely particularly in the bar and restaurant. The reception staff were not as friendly but still pleasant enough. We visited lake Bled on one day which was lovely. We didn't have a balcony room but this was a good thing since we noticed that on the balcony rooms they could be quite dangerous for very small children. The view from the hotel was beautiful and its very close to all the local amenities but also a not right in the centre so it was lovely and peaceful.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Lovely Hotel, Great Base For Skiing;4;5.03.2016;This is a really lovely hotel just 5 minutes or so from the ski slopes. We had one of the balcony rooms and it was spacious and comfortable. There was plenty of storage space, a sofa for lounging on and it was spotlessly clean. The bathroom was very smart and the shower was excellent. We found the staff very friendly, helpful and efficient.The food was good comfort food which is just what you want when skiing. There was a good range available at breakfast - I think I had something different every day. At dinner there was a range of starters, good choice of mains and some good puddings and a selection of fruit and ice cream available each evening.The only downside from a personal point of view is that there were a lot of young children in the hotel which made mealtimes less relaxing than we would have liked. We originally had a table in a fairly quiet corner but were moved when the tables had to be rearranged. I really don't mind being moved but we were given a table surrounded by crying babies and toddlers which was not what we wanted first thing in the morning! We did ask and were given another table without any problem but this was between 2 large family groups so again not as relaxing as it could be. The restaurant is large and it would be easy to have a quieter area allocated for people who want to enjoy a there meals in a child free environment. If this had been the case, I would cheerfully have rated this hotel 5.The spa was also very good with 2 pools and a whirlpool. A great place to relax your tired legs after skiing while watching the snow coming down outside.Overall I would thoroughly recommend this hotel.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Fabulous again (Something not right though);5;1.03.2016;This was our fourth stay at the Lek in as many years, Having young girls 10 & 6 we love the convenience of the Lek. It was great to see all the staff that have become friends and the fuss they all make about the girls is wonderful. Hotel as ever very clean and pool are spotless. Locker room at the hotel is more than adequate and never seems busy.Food at breakfast and dinner is as good as always and usually something for everyone with the choices available.We found out that the hotel is apparently up for sale and having been to this hotel and getting to know the staff you could sense that all was not well, don't get me wrong the service did not suffer and they were all as attentive as ever, but you can tell that there is some worry about their future.We returned back in Wales on Saturday 27th and called into the travel agents and have booked again for next year.I hope that the staff get reassurance and a buyer is found that doesn't change the hotel too much!!Thanks to all the staff and we look forward to seeing you all again next year, it is their hospitality that keeps bringing us back,;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Brilliant!!;5;27.02.2016;We stayed at Lek in 2015. We loved it so much we went back again in Feb 2016. I was sure we would be disappointed. I always think you are disappointed when you return to somewhere that was great the first time!I was wrong. Lek was even better the second time. The food was absolutely lovely . We really enjoyed it. The dinners were great, we are a family of 7 and all the kids ate so much every night. Valentine's night was lovely with the beautiful cake and free prosecco for everyone! Wow!Pools lovely, rooms clean. Will we return a third time?? Definitely!!

Great family ski holiday;5;20.02.2016;Stayed here with 3 kids in a family room which was large and clean. Breakfast and dinner were included - breakfast was just so-so, but dinner was great with lots of choices and a salad bar and fruit options too. The pool and jacuzzi were a bonus. Very friendly, helpful staff. The hotel is about a ten minute walk from the slopes. We were lucky with snow, and the skiing was good - although the runs are fairly short. All round it was a great family holiday.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Brill;5;18.02.2016;Fantastic hotel. Ideally situated for skiing (with older children that can carry their own ski stuff)!!!! Locker rooms don't get busy and meal times are quiet too.

Great Hotel;4;17.02.2016;Great hotel with excellent food at dinner! Very friendly staff, english and german speakers. Very close to the center of Kranjska Gora and to the ski slopes. The spa is free of charge but great, we had a bath in the spa every day for minimum 1 hour! A big minus is the wi fi wich doesen't work properly, I was forced to use my own cellular data on roaming wich is expensive!;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Great trip - skiing so so;5;29.01.2016;We are just here at the hotel Lek for our last night we have spent a week here on a crystal holiday and staying at the Lek. I must say for the amount of snow here (none) they have done a good job to keep runs open at all and are making snow when Cole enough we haven't skied as much as we would have liked as we have been used to bigger resorts and great snow but we have made the most of the trip going to a couple of places like lake Bled and lubliana which were really nice trips and very enjoyable. The hotel itself have lovely staff who are really friendly and cannot do enough for you food is good with quite a choice nice little bar downstairs and rooms are cleaned daily no problems there. We have treated it as a. It's break with a bit of skiing rather than a ski trip as the snow is not good at all once the sun moves round at 2.30 it is very flat light and ices up again. It is cheap to eat and drink out in Slovenia very cheap even hotel prices are great value.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Excellent;5;18.01.2016;Only had a business dinner here this time, but it was great as ever.

Crystal Ski Holiday;3;16.01.2016;Very friendly staff in the reception and restaurant. We stayed half board- buffet breakfast and dinner- quantity over quality was probably true- perhaps not 4 star quality- but was good for filling up for a day of skiing. Fresh salad bar available in evening, veggie options could perhaps be improved at dinner. Hotel is probably a 5-10 min walk to bottom of ski slopes- which can be tiring in ski boots- but not a major problem. No complaints to make- double room was small but was nice enough, good swimming pool facility and also a small fitness suite available.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Nice, traditional old school hotel;4;3.01.2016;Great staff, very polite and kind. Hotel is clean and well maintained. Nice spa facilities. Budget rooms are small, but cosy. Very nice food with variety of choices for both breakfast and dinner. Pancakes for breakfast are really good. Kranjska gora is really nice place with nice lake in vicinity. Prices in restaurants are quite affordable.Only remark we have is that WiFi is really unstable. It tends to collapse under high load. It was working ok only in early morning.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594

Great hotel;5;11.10.2015;We stayed there for a wellness weekend in the mid September. The food was great, and the staff were very friendly. The room was beyond our expectations, spacy with a great view on the mountains. The wellness part of the hotel (pools and saunas) is very clean and enjoyable. We did not visit any other hotel in Kranjska Gora, but Hotel Lek will be our destination every time we return.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Good facilities ;4;27.09.2015;Situated a little out of the village centre, the Lek is nonetheless within easy walking distance. Our room was good with a balcony on the more shady side of the hotel (it was very hot in Kranjska Gora when we were there, so the shady side was an advantage), but air conditioning would have been welcome. The pool was a good way of cooling down after the heat of the day.The food was perhaps not quite as good as the other four star hotels we used during our stay in Slovenia and prices in the bar were, how shall we say... Interestingly inconsistent!;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Fantastic Hotel;4;24.09.2015;Great food, lovely room and very helpful friendly staff in this hotel as well as a fab pool area. I could not fault the hotel at all.

Great location and service!;4;23.09.2015;We stayed here for 11 nights during our recent holiday in Slovenia. The location is perfect , a very short walk up the vrsic pass to the emerald water of Janas lake and a bus ride from the top of the pass and the spectacular walks and views from there. The hotel is handy for a wander into the lovely town of kranjska gora and access to the fantastic cycle way which provides a short hop to Italy.Our room was perfect , with a balcony and excellent bath and shower. All of the staff were so friendly and helpful and would help us with our pronunciation of Slovene words. The big let down with Hotel Lek was the food, particularly the breakfast. The salad bar was fine but the hot food, sitting in metal containers was often very stodgy and unappetising .the same salads would often appear at breakfast with a poor selection of cheeses and cold meats. There was a lack of fresh fruits, apart from melon everyday and sometimes plums or nectarines and no fresh coffee. Such a shame because in all other areas Hotel Lek is fantastic!;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Average Hotel;3;16.09.2015;Typical looking alpine style hotel. Rooms clean and comfortable. I stayed in eaves room with the high window. Food a bit repetitive but you'll always find something to eat. Main bug bare was tap water wasn't provided for free but had to pay E1.20 for a jug. Staff very friendly and helpful. The spa was nothing special. Pool extremely cold and jacuzzi came on and off sporadically. Had to pay extra for use of the steam room etc. Bar closed at 10 p.m. Unfortunately. Bonus drinks very cheap in Slovenie. Slovenia is a stunningly beautiful country, in particular the Lake Bled area. Kranska Gore a bit quiet this time of the year but I'm sure much livelier in winter and early summer.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Friendly hotel. Beautiful location. Some minor problems;4;15.09.2015;Stayed here in August 2015 with my family for a 14 night stay in Kranjska Gora in the Slovenian mountains. The hotel is located within 5 minutes walking distance to the centre of Kranjska Gora. The surrounding area is beautiful and the local people are friendly and warm.Unexpectedly there is a rather gauche sign at the entrance informing people not to bring their own food into the restaurant. You don't expect to see such signs outside an 4 Star Hotel. Our room with spacious private balcony (with wooden tables and chairs) was located at the rear of the hotel. It was quiet and great for getting a good night's sleep. Rooms at the front may have a better view of the mountains but the balconies are quite small and there may be some noise from the road nearby.The hotel staff we met were genuine, friendly, customer service oriented. The rooms are a good size and comfortable. The bathroom is good with separate shower, good selection of toiletries and good soft towels. There was a fridge in the room but there were no tea and coffee-making facilities. The house-keeping staff were friendly, excellent and unobtrusive.The hotel mainly offers half-board basis to various tour operators providing a package with breakfast and dinner included. The table you are given in the restaurant on your first day remains your table for your entire stay and in general those around you at other tables spoke your language which often lead to friendly conversation. Breakfast offers a cold selection plus hot food. Unfortunately the hot food was not regularly replenished at least not during our stay. Sadly the scambled egg wasn't properly prepared. There was streaky bacon that had a substantial fatty and bone content and though many people may like bacon this way I would have thought that a 4 star hotel could rise to providing good quality bacon for breakfast.Dinner offered a small salad buffet that was awkward to negotiate by children and hot foot was plentiful even if the choice was limited. Hot plates were provided. Although the food looked a bit jaded as if it was cooked too early and standing around for longer than ideal the service was cheerful and you could eat as much as you liked.The Lek has it´s own indoor swimming pool and spa area which was good and lockers for clothes are provided. The area was clean and tidy. There is a tennis court near the hotel. Wifi is free but it's slow. At the rear of the downstairs bar there is a table for table-tennis.The bar is on the ground-floor and the staff there are friendly and helpful. Bar food of paninis and sandwiches (made in advance) are offered. Nevertheless we certainly enjoyed our time at the Lek. All of the problems we encountered are minor and can easily be remedied. We would definitely recommend the hotel as a good friendly place to stay.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594

Could have been Great..... but.....;3;31.08.2015;Convenient location, pleasant, efficient staff, lovely pool, what's not to like? We had read a review raving about the food. The food was very poor. The same cooked food for breakfast everyday. Browned scrambled egg swimming in an watery fluid. Chewy pancakes, sausage slices, hard and curling at the edges. A queue for the coffee/hot water machine, and the coffee was very tasteless. The food for the evening meals seemed as if even though a varied menu all looked as if it had been in a steam tray for ages and tasted it. All in metal, 'Butlins'type containers. The plates were in a plate warmer that wasn't warm.There was a ticket system for 'your' table which was yours for the duration of the stay. However incoming coach tours often just took your table, leaving you wondering around trying to find a table that wasn't already reserved or had been used.The room was shabby and dark. The ceiling over the bath had had a leak and the plaster was falling off. The very efficient manager did have it replastered immediately. the bedside drawer couldn't open as there was a wall there. The wardrobe was so close to the end of the bed that if the door was opened, there was no room to pass. The neighbouring rooms plumbing noises were amazingly loud, and voices were clearly audible.THe downstairs bar produced fantastic coffee but was often empty- no games or reading allowed there. The area for card games etc was in the reception area and small, often occupied.Others felt the same and people often eat outside the hotel.Fellow travellers staying at the skipass hotel and the Pension LIpa raved about their stay and the delicious food. Wish we could have done the same;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Friendly hotel in wonderful location - but with some problems;3;26.08.2015;"Stayed here with my family for a 4 night stay in the Slovenian mountains. The hotel has the most wonderful location and all the staff we met were genuinely friendly, smiling and service minded. The rooms are large but somewhat in need of an update but still comfortable. The hotel works mostly on a half-board basis where you have breakfast and dinner inclusive. Breakfast is fine and offers a good selection. Dinner is more tricky with \theme nights\"" such as \""Balkan Buffet\"". It´s all a matter of taste and the food was plentiful and well prepared. Each evening also had a good offer for wine and other beverages. However, the dinner buffet option wasn´t really a child friendly selection every night. Dropping the ice cream dessert cart on \""Balkan night\"" and instead offering a selection of local brandy didn´t make a lot of sense and seemed to cater for two very different audiences... The hotel has it´s own indoor swimming pool area which was very nice. Also there´s a good local tennis course just next door where hotel guests can play for half price. Our room - 119 - cannot be recommended. It faced the hotel backside where every morning from around 5.30 deliveries were being made for the kitchen in a very noisy manner. It´s not really helpful for the sleeping experience... So it´s important to ask for a room at the front side of the hotel with mountain views. Wifi was offered for free but was very slow. But having said that, it´s all in all a hotel to be recommend - especially for location and the very friendly staff.""";Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594

Lek lacks nothing;5;31.07.2015;My wife and I returned last week from two weeks at the Hotel Lek-organised through Thomson. This was our third time at the hotel having last stayed five years ago. Our first time was 25 years ago !We stayed in a superior room on the ground floor. The room was in all fairness, did not seem as big as other superior rooms but had the advantage of being about 20 seconds away from reception.I would whole heartedly endorse the comments from members Ann, Pandora , Richard and Lorraine and would add the following:-Unfortunately my wife had an accident on the first evening - 7 hours into the holiday when our wooden toilet seat broke as the lid was lifted and it fell on my wife's arm. She has very thin skin and was not wearing her arm protectors as she was about to take a shower. To cut a long story short the seat falling caused a deep gash with the bleeding from the wound getting worse during the night despite the fact that we go well prepared for such occurrences.Thomson and the hotel did everything it could to minimise our distress -arranging taxis to get us to A and E, ensuring the room was cleaned beds were changed and night attire laundered by 8.00 the next morning and providing complementary fruit in the room.My wife had her 70th birthday at the start of the second week and the Lek’s response was amazing with a very special dinner and present from the staff. Some of you may think this may have been a knee jerk response on the premise that we might complain/sue - we know the risks when you travel and you have thin skin so we made it clear there was was never any question of this and , more the point , hotel staff were also great on our two previous visits. Moreover, other guests having birthdays had special treatment.We were overwhelmed by the kindness and willingness to help shown throughout the holiday. Jadran the Maître D was as marvellous as ever – talking to everyone as they entered the dining room and with an eagle eye to make sure the place ran smoothly but the entire staff team played their part. All were highly professional, knowledgeable and nothing was a bother. Like other members’ posts, I do not recognise the Hotel Lek described by the lady who gave the two star review. We did meet one lady who also travelled alone who said the staff had made her feel more welcome than anyway she had stayed before We booked early and got a Thomson bonus 100 euros each to spend in the restaurant and Kaverna which made the hotel astonishingly good value for money. The Gym is pretty decent - a previous reviewer said some of the machines don’t work - some are mains powered and others run on batteries and the cross trainer needs a new battery but actually you can still use it as the resistance levels are not dependent on there being power. It’s actually quite liberating not having a read out ! The only areas where I thought there was a negative difference from previous visits - there was noticeably not as much choice or variety on the menu and certainly not for vegetarians - but it seemed to get better in the second week . I also understand from other guests that the leisure pool facilities eg drench shower were not available all the time whereas 5 years ago they were. I didn't have personal experience of this as my wife was unable to use the pool because of her injury. Wi fi access in our hotel room was very hit and miss-however it was superb in the Kaverna so a very good excuse to have a coffee in there after dinner if you wanted access to t'internet.Special mention has to go to Gabby the Thomson rep who lives at the hotel who is simply an angel who went well beyond the call of duty in everything she did. An exceptionally helpful young lady whose genuine bubbliness was infectious - and in her debut season too! Go on her and colleague Nicky’s Schnapps Night – its great funSlovenia is having a tough time economically. This may be a hugely sentimental thing to say but it’s like the Hotel staff put even more of their hearts and souls into their jobs to make up for this. The hotel’s palpable team spirit gives out a lot of love to guests and creates a remarkable atmosphere . This is no automaton “have a nice day” nonsense - it’s a natural talent they all have. It encourages guests to talk to each other and make friends. So, what could have been a disaster actually turned into one of the best holidays in Slovenia ( 14 and counting ) we have ever had.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Great base for mountain holiday;4;17.07.2015;His is one of those hotels that has decided what it wants to deliver and then does it very well. The location is superb with great views of the Julian Alps. We stayed in a first floor superior room with a balcony. It was a good size, clean and comfortable. Wifi was pretty good too.Don't expect haute cuisine in the dining room as the Lek provides a buffet service with lots of good hearty food. The drink offers that come with each night's meal offer great value including bottles of wine at below 9 euros.I'd prefer to pay more for the food and have something a little more up-market. E.g we styled at. Great place in Selva where you ordered your main course with breakfast so the kitchens know in advance what they had to prepare. But you can't be too critical when so many people are repeat guests (including us!)All the staff are helpful and welcoming We stayed on a Thompsons Lakes and Mountains package and the service from their team was really good.If you fancy a change from mountains we can also recommend a two centre break with Piran.All in all a really good holiday - not sure I want to go back to work.Finally some things about the area. There is a lot to see (especially when the weather is good). We can recommend:- the tri border walk from Ratece.- the waterfall in Gozd Martelek- The waterfalls in Mojstrana, especially the walk behind the first falls- the local buses - especially to VrsicAnd lots more!;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Great holiday at a very good price;5;16.07.2015;As always I base my review on value for money and overall experience rather than level of luxury. We returned yesterday from 14 days at the Hotel Lek as part of the Thomson Lakes & Mountains Discovery Package. As well as 14 nights half board accommodation this included 2 full day excursions, a chairlift pass, walking maps and a guided walk (which actually the hotel offers free of charge twice a week in high season). We travelled with our adult son and paid just over L3000.00 for an eaves room and a superior room with balcony. As a special offer for early booking we were given 100 euros credit each to spend in the bar or restaurant so our bill at the end of the fortnight came to nothing.SloveniaIt was our first time here and it won’t be the last. The people are delightful, the scenery is stunning and the walking possibilities are fabulous. In a nutshell it combines the best features of Austria and Northern Italy but at a much cheaper price.Hotel A medium sized hotel in a quiet location on the edge of the small town. Fabulous views from the dining room and the terrace. It has a nice indoor pool area with jacuzzi which opens out onto a rather uninspiring sunbathing area with a few rather uncomfortable loungers. The gardens however are spacious and well maintained. RoomsThe eaves room was adequate for a single person but could, I feel, be cramped and claustrophobic for a couple. It did however have fridge & safe which we were not expecting. The superior room was much more spacious and the ability to lock the balcony door in a partially open position was most welcome as the weather was very warm particularly during our first week. If you can afford it I highly recommend paying the supplement for the superior room. Cleaning was of a very high standard and toiletries (shower gel, shampoo & body lotion) were replenished daily. Soap was provided in a dispenser so if, like my husband, you prefer to use a bar you will need to take your own.StaffAbsolutely wonderful – they were without exception pleasant, friendly and eager to please. Their attempts to engage with all of the guests in English, German, Italian and various other languages left me (a former languages teacher) in total awe!Dining Room experienceOn your first evening you are shown by the head waiter to a table which you keep for the entire stay. He apologised for having to give us a table by the entrance (we thought it was fine) and said he would find us a better one as soon as possible. This he duly did two days later. Breakfasts are entirely buffet service. The cold option offers five or six good quality meats (various hams, salami, mortadella etc.) and around three varieties of cheese as well as different pâtés. The hot option consists of pancakes with a fruit sauce, scrambled or boiled eggs, roasted vegetables, sausages and bacon. In addition there are different types of cereal, bread rolls, croissants, jams, fresh, dried and tinned fruit, assorted nuts and yoghurts. Entrees at evening meal were buffet style with the usual selection of salads – beetroot, tomatoes, cucumber, sweetcorn, carrot plus a choice of three prepared dishes usually featuring meat, cheese or fish. The two soups on offer each evening are served to guests. The pasta (invariably delicious and different every evening) and vegetarian sections of the main course are self service whilst the other dishes (two meat choices and a fish dish) are served to you. Portions are generous and if you want more you only need to ask. I have to say that whilst most nights it was fine there were occasionally some odd concoctions here and depending on how long the food had been standing it could be a little overdone. It is impossible however to go hungry as a previous reviewer has suggested. The dessert table always has a choice of several different cakes in addition to the fresh fruit, four flavours of icecream and cheeses available. Wine, beer and soft drinks (especially the offers of the day) were very good value. Service was prompt and efficient.I rarely comment on previous reviews as everyone is entitled to their own opinion but on this occasion I intend to make an exception. The one I have alluded to in the previous paragraph comparing dinner to a scene from Oliver appeared whilst we were away and was being discussed with total incredulity by the many guests who follow Tripadvisor. People (especially the many repeat customers) were genuinely upset and angry at the allegation that staff were rude, ignorant and unhelpful. Likening the food to woodlice casserole (whatever that may taste like) is as unkind as it is untrue. On investigation however it turns out that this lady has been dissatisfied with the majority of places she has visited (almost three quarters of her reviews are rated poor or terrible) and has been regularly singled out for abuse by hotel staff and fellow guests alike. She has compared food elsewhere to Pedigree Chum and Whiskas (cat food) and she is certainly no stranger to luncheon meat on her travels! Tripadvisor is a wonderful tool when researching accommodation but clearly poor reviews (even when they are at odds with the majority) can badly damage an institution’s reputation and business. I urge anyone looking to book the Hotel Lek in the future take this one with a very large pinch of salt!;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Summer holiday in Krajska Gora;4;16.07.2015;The hotel was located just outside the centre of Kranjska Gora, well designed with good views of the mountains. We were in a superior room with balcony and had a mini-bar, a very small safe only suitable for passports etc. Bathroom was modern and shower very powerful (lifting the shower head off the holder if turned too high). Beds were comfortable and overall rooms were clean and well laid out.My two sons were in a larger room in the eaves. Also a very good room but the sun came in during the morning and the room became very hot despite two opening windows. Breakfast was buffet style and offered a good selection of cold meat and cheese, different breads with jam, chocolate spread, honey etc, toast, sausages, scrambled eggs, fresh fruit (peaches were excellent). Boiled eggs were hard boiled, luke-warm and grey, my wife like them warm and soft so only had one on the first morning. My favourite was yogurt with fruit (prunes, plums, pineapple, peaches). There were also cereals (chocolate balls, cornflakes muesli, nuts dried fruit etc etc. Tea coffee was from a machine so if busy this could be a little slow. Fruit juice was ? diluted concentrate.Dinner was also a buffet. Not what I would call 4* but very filling. Lots of starters including some excellent salads.Choice of 4 - 5 items for main course. Some items do not serve well on a buffet, fish was generally over cooked and dry but pasta, vegetarian option, casseroles were all good. Soup looked okay but didn't have it. Deserts were the same each day and included cakes, fresh fruit, ice-cream. The hotel offered a wide range of drinks with a special menu each evening, bottle of house wine 8.99 euro (very drinkable) and beers including the local brews were very good (2 euro / 500 ml).The staff were mostly very good and were helpful in all respects. However just watch your plate! Take care, the staff clear the tables very quickly, my son picked up his bread to apply butter and his plate had gone!

Superb location - jaw dropping views of the beautiful Julian Alps;4;2.07.2015;We are huge fans of this part of Slovenia, the Triglav National Park and it's outstanding beauty and the friendliness of the Slovenian people. We took a Thomson Lakes and Mountains short break in Hotel Lek and it certainly did not disappoint. Every single member of staff from reception, dining room, bar, cleaning staff could not have been more welcoming, hospitable and friendly. Our room was spotless, cleaned every day. Contrary to a fellow travellers review we found the food plentiful, well cooked and enough choice to cater for different nationalities. Yes, it is buffet style but the main meal is served by courteous staff and the portions are more than generous. There is a good variety of cold starters including fish meat cheese salads vegetarian etc. There is ample choice on the deserts section also cheeses, fruit, and icecreams. An added bonus, and other hotels, home and away should take a leaf out of their book, is they discounted the wine and beer by 40% at dinner. So on average a bottle of wine whilst we were there cost 6.88 - 9 euros PER BOTTLE choice of red or white and it was branded wine. Again branded beer was 2 euros plus. A large jug of water and ice was 1 euro 20.for a hotel, this is fantastic value. After dinner, from the dining room, go out onto the terrace, finish your drinks and relax watching the sun setting over the majestic Julian Alps. The hotel is 5 - 10 minute walk into the small town, same to the beautiful small Jasna Lake. We would certainly recommend Hotel Lek for all the above qualities and would not hesitate to come back. Well done and thank you to the staff, a credit to tourism, also the Thomson rep.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
well run Hotel;5;1.07.2015;Me and my Husband arrived back from Hotel Lek 24th June after staying 7nights half board.Hotel staff very good.Food in Restaurant was very tasty.Maybe some would prefer a wider choice but we were satisfied.Buffet in the evening is actually a served buffet and a Lady on the serving over a couple of nights who, appeared to be training was very sparing and noticed a few guests,mainly men had to ask for a larger portion'.Oliver' sprang to mind.However the other Dinner Lady was more generous and helpful.The Room 20 we had was more than we could wish for.Beautiful views and large balcony,large room and bathroom which had a shower cubicle,suiting us more than a bath.It was at the back of the Hotel so very quiet.Perfect! It was worth paying extra for Superior room with balcony.The Hotel has a indoor pool (not heated) and a smaller pool (heated)and a Jacuzzi.We used these on a daily basis before Dinner.The Gym has five machines but told only two worked but my Husband made use of the treadmill and bike.Kranska Gora is a beautiful village,outstanding views of the Julian Alps and a 15 min walk takes you to Lake Jesna just up the hill from Hotel.The village is so peaceful with few cars.We took the local bus which was approx. 10 mins walk from hotel to Ljubluja capital of Slovenia.Although it took 2hrs the countryside was good to see.It is about 20mins walk from the Bus station down to the Old Town but worth seeing.Chic cafes and shops along a beautiful river and a Castle to see.35euros return for the two of us.Another local bus trip we made was a bus to Lesce 25mins and then get bus from there to Lake Bled 5mins 25euros for two of us return.Fabulous Lake Lidos,cafes,wonderful ice cream shops,boat rides.Well worth seeing.We travelled with Thomson and couldn't fault our journey.Dont be put off by the transfer time to Kranska Gora from Saltzberg 2/3hrs.We were in a mini bus and the very courteous driver stopped for a comfort break giving the chance to use toilet facilities(50cents) and get coffee etc.The morning we left hotel for home 5.40am the Hotel had left a food and drinks parcel which would of fed a whole family! but very grateful.The coffe machine was available for a drink before our mini bus picked us up for the Airport.Our two Thomson Reps in the resort Gabby and Nikki were on hand to answer any queries.We would recommend this hotel and resort.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Great location, friendly staff;4;30.06.2015;Hotel Lek is my favourite place in Kranjska gora. It is not in the very center but its location is great. With the view on the mountains you have feeling that you are somewhere up there. It is also 10 minutes walk from the center or from the lake Jasna. This is a beautiful lake and in the past there was also a restaurant on the beach. It was a very good restauratnt and a very good place to to seat by the lake. Now there is nothnig by the lake to seat, have maybe just cofffee and enjoy the view. What a pitty.Hotel staff is one of the most king I have ever seen. Helpful, friendly, domestic.Food is great and their sweets are amazing.Rooms are very different types, some with balcony. You can choose what you like. But to be honest, they need a little bit renovation.You can visit this hotel in any time of the year. Winter is for skiing as Kranjska gora is well known skiing center, and summer is for hiking and other sport activities. There is a lot to do in Kranjska gora if you like sports or nature.I always enjoy to visit this hotel. It makes me feel welcome and like at home.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Please Sir Can I Have Some More?;2;30.06.2015;"I recently stayed here as a part of Thomson Lakes and Mountains programme. The first thing I noticed how rude and discourteous the staff were upon check in. The man on reception plonked my key on the counter and the only words he uttered were and I quote \swimming ten euros.\"" I asked him where the room was and when the meal times were but no information was given. He just pointed to a sign behind him with the times on. I struggled to find the room myself. I had asked for a room near the lift but was given one right down the corridor. The room itself was fine. It was clean, light and airy and the windows opened fully at first (until they locked them). I was on the third floor in room 211 (confusing). However there was no balcony. The bed was comfortable with just right pillows, the room was of a decent size and at least the TV wasn't mounted on the ceiling unlike some places. The wifi didn't work in the room. The hotel is not modern but traditional style and it is clean.The difficulty I encountered was at meal times. Meal times were abysmal. You have to order a drink from the restaurant and they kept \""forgetting\"" to serve me. Then when it comes it is in a tiny bottle and not what you want. There is no water on the tables. The first night I went to get some soup but the there is a server who insists on doing it for you. Not a problem with this except when it came to my main course. I got the tiniest piece of meat you ever did see. It was a doll's portion rather than a child's portion. I wanted more and she kept saying 'OK OK.' I replied 'No it’s not OK I want some more' but she refused and wouldn't let go of the serving spoon. I went to bed very hungry that night having to fill up on chocolate which was no good for my diabetes. The next night I encountered same problem, this time with a male member of staff. He gave me one tiny meatball and when I said I wanted more he told me authoritively 'ENOUGH ENOUGH.' I tried to get him to relinquish the serving spoon but he clung on tightly. The next night I attempted a \""smash and grab' manoeuvre when they had their backs turned but to no avail. I felt like Oliver Twist the whole time begging and grovelling for more. This is supposed to be a buffet but it isn’t. Apart from this the food is cold and unappetising one night it was something along the lines of woodlice casserole. They were the rudest unhelpful of hotel staff I ever met and seemed to single me out for particularly bad treatment because I was a single traveller. They weren’t asking if I had enough they were TELLING me that's enough. Breakfast was equally bad with an extremely limited selection of luncheon meat, hard cardboard cereal and yoghurt. I also couldn't get served in the bar either they are so ignorant. I also asked for a bin in my room which they refused until the rep asked then I got one on my last day. I wouldn’t recommend this hotel to anyone. It is near the centre well about 10 minutes’ walk or so but it is not the best I am sure there are better. However Slovenians in general do not seem to be very welcoming to tourists.""";Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Friendly & good prices;4;20.06.2015;Our eaves room was small but we knew that when we booked and it was good value for money and cleaned every day. The staff were friendly and food overall was good. The starters and large choice of salad was lovely, the puddings were very nice, it was only the mains I found average but there were say 3 to 4 choices so I always found something I was happy with. The drinks etc were really reasonably priced ('Slovenian prices') and again there was a good choice. We could hire bikes from the hotel and the pool area was nice, a good sized swimming pool, a whirl pool, and a small pool / jacuzzi area. We never used the sauna areas as it was extra money and you had to be naked which is how I'm told they do it on the continent! But I peeped and it looked really relaxing.The hotel is on the outskirts of town but that actually means its 5 to 10 minutes away so fine and quiet. The views of the mountains were wonderful but the they are everywhere in Kranska Gora. Anyway, we had a really nice week.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Cannot agree with a 4* rating;3;19.06.2015;We stopped here for 3 nights as part of a Slovenian tour with Inghams and we had to have half board as B/B was not an option.The superior room we had with balcony was No. 138 and was good, spacious, quiet, lovely view over village and mountains. Very comfortable bed, plenty of storage and Wifi worked very well. Bathroom small but well equipped. No bath but a corner shower which worked well but could with do with a proper soap dish.Facilities in hotel ok but tired looking and dated. Gym room definitely not inspiring, and swimming pool passable but nothing to get excited about.Dining room again passable but we were allocated same table every day and were not in the best location but staff objected to us choosing another table although plenty of empty tables.Breakfast very poor. Layout poor, Choice and quality poor, especially the fruit and looked like what was left over from dinner previous night.Dinner was a buffet every evening and it felt like queuing up in a canteen. Again poor choice.The hotel has a good location to the village but we were pleased to only be staying for 3 nights and would suggest if you are staying here do so on room only or B/B.Hotel as part of the Inghams package provided a packed lunch consisting of a bread without butter sandwich and a small bottle of water.It was a pity that the lovely room we had was not matched by the hotel dining experience.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
A great place to stay;5;14.06.2015;My wife and I stayed on the ground floor with a balcony, room was very spacious, clean with plenty of storage space, Wi-Fi signal very good. Buffet breakfasts and evening meals with excellent choices and even when we had early starts for excursions we could go into the restaurant and have breakfast before the official opening time. Extremely helpful staff, nothing is a trouble for them. The hotel is situated just a few minutes walk from the centre of town, there is a bar area some of which is outside and it is great to be sitting at night with a drink admiring the views of the mountain ranges.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Doesn't deliver a four star experience;3;13.06.2015;The hotel is conveniently situated, an easy stroll into town, and is modern, clean, and staffed with friendly folks speaking an enviable range of languages. However, as part of the Lec chain, it delivers quite a different experience from the family-run hotels in Slovenia.Our room had clearly been designed by an architect who was working to a tight budget - it was cramped and airless, almost unbearably hot during an early summer heat wave. Meals were served buffet style, which mostly were OK, but the main courses at dinner were chunks of unappetizing meat or fish and tired veg dished out like school dinners of yesteryear.There is free wi-fi, but the only place I could get a reliable signal was by lurking in the first floor conference room.Our deal (through Inghams) included a packed lunch - one large dry sandwich, a bottle of water, and sometimes an apple. I feel sorry for anyone who paid €5.50 for this.Sorry, I can't really recommend this hotel.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
An amazing stay in Hotel Lek;5;8.06.2015;We had booked this hotel via internet after reading reviews on TA before. When we arrived in a hotel we have been surprised how the staff was polite, always friendly and ready to help us with all our questions.Our room was at mansard but it was very comfortable and extremely clean.Food and restaurant staff was also great. Breakfast was the same every day with a wide spectrum of salami, eggs and fruits etc, but dinner was different every day - very tasty.Location of the hotel is great, on a road to Vrsic and just 5 min walk to the centre of the Kranjska Gora village.The hotel offers a spa area, but we didn't use it. This is not the newest hotel and it could be modernised, but the staff, location, cleanliness and food are great.Wifi is free in all hotel, rooms included, and works flawless.We would definitely pick this hotel again for our next stay in Kranjska Gora.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Very friendly and very good value for money.;4;8.06.2015;"My wife and I went on an early season walking holiday and used this hotel as a base, eating there every evening. All of the staff that we dealt with were polite and helpful and spoke perfect or passable English/German/Italian. Some staff were 10/10 excellent. Our front-facing room was fine for our purposes; small balcony with view up the valley; plenty of space; safe, fridge, shower/bath; cleaning was good; light sleepers may prefer the rear rooms in the summer, as the nights are hot and the road, river and transfer coaches create a certain level of noise (it didn't bother us). Walls and floors sound-proof. Food was better than at other half-board hotels we have been in; not great, but always something to enjoy. The few Slovenian dishes that wandered on to the menu were very good. The restaurant would definitely benefit from a wine list, however short, as the house wines were unimpressive and the pink fizz ghastly French stuff. The bar is well run and relaxed.Kranjska Gora comes to life in the first week of June, being very quiet beforehand. Walks range from 'peaceful' to 'adventurous', with the harder walks being spiced up by the laughbaly inadequate maps of the region.";Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594

Short stay Slovenia;4;1.04.2015;This year I had the fantastic opportunity of being at the Ski Jumping World Cup in Planica. We booked a room at Hotel Lek in the nearby village of Kranjska Gora. It was conveniently located and, overall, very comfortable. Our booking came with half board so we had dinner and breakfast at the hotel. Both were served buffet style, and were satisfying enough... although perhaps not for vegetarians. The staff were friendly and welcoming and the hotel room comfortable. We were offered free use of the sauna/jacuzzi area downstairs but didn't make use of it.The village itself is lovely to stroll through, and there are many places to sit outside and have a cold beer :). Take a drive about 7km outside of Kranjska Gora (into Slovenia) and enjoy the beautiful scenery. There is also an exquisite wooden chapel along the way.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594

Excellent Stay;5;10.03.2015;Stayed here as part of Crystal Ski package deal, everything from the food to the swimming pool, staff and bedrooms was first class. Was not a long walk to the slopes.

Would certainly stay there again.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Fantastic staff;4;9.03.2015;We booked in here as part of a Crystal Ski holiday having read the good reviews on Tripadvisor.The booking with Crystal included half board and we enjoyed the food on the whole. Both breakfast and dinner had loads of choices. Breakfast included cereals, breads, meats and cheeses, croissants, bacon, eggs, sausages, pancakes, yoghourts and more. Dinner was three courses, usually four choices of starter, main and puddings. You could mix and match as it is all buffet style help yourself.The quality of the food varied, mostly it was good. However some dishes were poor whilst some were very good. Its worth taking a good look around at the options before making a decision.Drinks with breakfast are included but not with dinner, with breakfast there is water, fruit juice and tea, coffee and hot chocolate, all from machines. For dinner there is a full drinks menu but also daily specials which include red, white and rose wine as well as soft drinks and beers. Prices were reasonable. We opted for red wine most evenings and they ranged from very drinkable to very undrinkable. The Hotel Lek house red was good and we can recommend trying that. A couple of bottles were more like sherry though.From the reception to the bar and restaurant the staff were excellent, very friendly and helpful.The hotel was very clean and the rooms are serviced daily. We were booked into an eaves room and it was an OK size. However some of the eaves rooms are a very good size. If you want a little extra space ask for a bigger eave room. The shower was excellent, very good pressure and always hot water.They have a ski locker room in the basement and its very handy for storing skis, boards and boots in. There is a 5 Euro deposit for the key and I would recommend getting a locker per person if you are a boarder. Skiers can just about fit two pairs of skis in a single locker but its a bit of a knack to get them in and lock the door.The swimming pool area was good, again clean and functional and was included in the room price but the sauna and other facilities were chargeable separately at a daily rate, 7 Euros a day when we stayed.The bar area is nice for a drink before dinner. However its a bit cheaper to head into a bar in town and there was often not much of an atmosphere in the evenings we found.Its an easy five minute walk to the first ski lifts, once you find you way through the back lanes. The slopes are perfect for beginner and intermediate skiers.I would happily stay here again and would recommend to anyone wanting to use Kranjska Gora as a base for either skiing, biking or hill walking. It seemed to us to be a child friendly place too. The staff were good with the children and they seemed to be catered for well in the restaurant too.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Great stay at Hotel Lek;5;8.03.2015;The staff, room and food was excellent. Always there to help you with any query. The food selection each day was superb for both breakfast and dinner. The room was always clean and comfortable. Really enjoyed the swimming pool and jacuzzi. Location to the slopes was only a 5 minute walk. Would definitely stay there again. My one downer was that I thought the 7 Euros for the sauna was slightly steep but something that defiantly wouldn't put you off your stay.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594

A great stay at the Hotel Lek;5;2.03.2015;This was our first skiing trip to Slovenia, also we usually self cater, and have not had good experiences of ski resort hotels in Italy and France. However, this hotel was really good in every way. There were four adults in our party.Despite being a budget price holiday, we had excellent and varied food presented as a self service buffet, and the menu was given outside the restaurant every day. Our table was allotted on arrival and that was really nice, furthermore there was a late supper put out for our arrival from Salzburg, which was popular, as well as sandwiches for the journey back.The staff were all extremely helpful and friendly and there was a very nice atmosphere in the hotel.Our rooms were very comfortable and had good views and were quiet. Generally the sound insulation in the hotel was good.When we stayed it was Slovenian half term and so there were a lot of families staying at the hotel. The children were without exception well behaved and happy and added to the atmosphere. The swimming pool was a real bonus and even though it was half term it did not really get overcrowded. If I were to find a criticism there could have been more changing areas in the pool, but you could go up to your room and a bathrobe was useful for this. The swimming pool was large but there was also a toddlers pool, a whirlpool and a warm pool with jets, lovely after a day of skiing.The hotel is about a 5 minute walk to the bottom of the ski lifts and hire shops. We hired our skis and a locker right by the bottom of the lift to leave our skis and boots, which is far preferable to carrying skis back to the hotel and walking in boots, though it does have lockers. We finished skiing and then walked back through the town, stopping for a hot chocolate or beer and looking around the shops etc.The hotel bar in the basement was comfortable and a very civilised place to have a drink before supper and a coffee afterwards.Altogether we were most agreeably surprised and considered everything to be extremely good value. We had a most relaxing stress free holiday. We would definitely return, particularly with children and grandchildren as it is a wonderful family hotel.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594

Thanks to Crystal for arranging this.I have to say that all the staff at the Lek are pleasant and very friendly and always willing to help you.As we have returned for three years in a row we have made friends with the staff and just saying \thank you\"" in Slovenian (Hvala) goes a long way.The pools are great but the larger one is a little cold when you first get in and the whole area is extremely clean and a 10 euro deposit for a wristband used for access all weekFree wifi.We had a large family room again and this was cleaned daily with clean towels when needed.Great ski locker room with lockers only costing a 5 euro deposit.5 minute walk to slopes from locker room.

Nearly a five;4;2.02.2015;The only reason I'm not giving this place a five is due to one member of staff who works on reception. He was working when we arrived on the afternoon of 17th January, after a long transfer from Salzburg and without any sort of greeting, he demanded our passports and handed us our keys without saying much else. We had one other dealing with him later in the week. We were waiting for our key at the reception desk while he was on the phone and after he finished the call, he walked past my wife, totally ignoring her, to another guest who had just walked in and apologised to them for the wait! After dealing with them he handed my wife our key without saying a word. Apart from him, every other staff member was fantastic and a real credit to this hotel.Our room was a decent size for two adults and a 3 year old, with plenty of storage space. We had a big balcony with table and chairs, which was decent for hanging up our ski stuff. There was a tv, with quite a few English language channels and a fridge/ minibar which we stocked with our own stuff. There was also a safe and there is free wifi, but not a great signal in our room but good in common areas.The hotel itself had a good swimming pool area (€10 deposit for one wristband which covers your whole group. The wristband also operates the lockers in the changing area), ski equipment lockers (€5 deposit, can fit 2 sets of skis/boots/poles but snowboards are a squeeze!) and a nice, quiet cafe bar on the ground floor (€2.90 for a 500mL beer and you usually get a free bowl of pretzels/nuts with that). I found the food for breakfast and dinner to be plentiful and of decent quality, despite being a buffet affair. For breakfast there was - a choice of numerous types of rolls, sausages, bacon, scrambled eggs, boiled eggs, fried peppers, omelettes, pancakes, yoghurts, toast with numerous jams and marmalade, juice, numerous types of teas and coffees, cereals, fruit, numerous types of ham and cheese - plenty choice, unless you're really fussy and only eat coco pops! Dinner consisted of - 4 different cold appetisers each night (salmon, huomous, sardines, terrines etc), 2 soups, salad bar, 2 different meat dishes each night, 1 different fish dish each night, 1 different veggie option each night, fruit, ice cream, 3 or 4 different desserts each night - again, plenty choice unless you diet consists entirely of chips! The different drink deals each night are brilliant - A different beer each night for €2 ( A tin of Guinness poured into a wine glass, how sophisticated!) and bottles of red/white wine costing €7-€8. And you get a free shot on your first night which was appreciated.The location of the hotel is superb, a quiet area on the edge of town but only 5 minutes walk to the slopes and numerous cafes and restaurants. You can also walk out of town, through forests, to Jasna lake in 15 minutes which is nice Despite the snow not being great and skiing limited for the more experienced, we had an excellent holiday and would not hesitate in returning to this hotel.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Great hotel!;5;28.01.2015;We have just returned from our first trip to Slovenia. We visited for a ski trip with our five children. It was their first time skiing.From beginning to end we were very happy with the hotel. Special thanks to Roman who answered all my pre trip questions with such patience and good humour !!The poor man - how is your snow today, what are the beds like,what is for dinner,what is for breakfast etc.etc. the list goes on....The decor is a little dated but was fine. Rooms and hotel were spotless . Cleaned every day, towels changed ,bed linen changed during the week. All facilities were spotless ,very important .We had two big eaves rooms and found them spacious and adequate for our needs. Room temperature was not stifling but bathroom area had a great radiator which was perfect for drying wet ski gear.Pools were lovely and a big hit with us all, again spotless. The main pool was a little cold but I think they upped the temperature near the end of our stay and it was much more pleasant. We went to the pools every day, great break from skiing.Food was really fabulous, we were very impressed. Four cold starters , a warm starter, two soups and a number of mains were on offer every night. Mostly delicious, I gained about half a stone eating the gorgeous food!!!Lovely steak, goose with red cabbage, hearty, filling and tasty. Good salad bar too.Desserts were the highlight of the day with our kids they were delicious! Self service ice cream a dream come true for my gang anyway.Wine was super value and very drinkable. It's a pity tap after was not available. Bottles were expensive.Breakfast was also good, lots of choice, fresh and tasty.Real croissants / pastries would have been nice. And real juice. The self service juice machine seemed to serve squash as opposed to juice?But they are just small issues. Dining staff could not have been nicer to us or our kids.Hotel Lek is a short pleasant stroll from the village and the slopes. The are beautiful views from the hotel. The hotel is excellent value for money, we were extremely happy overall. We have recommended the hotel to a number of people.We plan to return next year. Thank you ,Hotel Lek, for a wonderful holiday.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Great for family ski;4;26.01.2015;Great place to stay with family, just a couple of minutes walk to the ski slopes and the town center. The Hotel appears dated in its appearance but is up to date in terms of facilities. The restaurant staff make a great effort.The swimming pool facilities are very good. With a Lap pool, a feature pool, a whirlpool and a small children s pool. Our room was spotlessly clean with comfortable beds although the bathroom was very small.This Hotel is Billed as 4**** but it is 4 stars based on facilities and comfort rather than luxury.Ski Lockers are available in the basement for guests but we rented one closer to the slopes as we felt carrying all the gear including kids gear was just that little bit too far.If Skiing in Kranjska Gora, the Hotel Lek should defiantly be considered.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Hotel Lek;4;22.01.2015;The Hotel is on the edge of town, five minutes walk to the centre. Good comfortable rooms. The staff are friendly. Breakfast is excellent, evening meals are ok but a bit repetitive. Each night a different drink was on offer which was good. Packed lunches ok, lunch served at the hotel was excellent, and good value, overall a good stay in a very nice location.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Fantastic hotel, great location, fab food & facilities;5;18.01.2015;We visited the Hotel Lek over the Christmas 2014 period, a group of 2 adults and 2 kids. The transfer to the hotel was good (through Crystal Ski who I can highly recommend and will definitely travel with again). We arrived late in the evening at the hotel, after dinner service had finished. Having booked in at Reception, which was all very swift and professional, and taken our cases to our rooms, we ventured downstairs to the restaurant where a meal had been left ready for all late arrivals. Fruit, cold meats, bread etc, very welcome indeed and very tasty. We were told that this would be our table for the whole week which made things very straightforward.Our rooms were on the second floor of the main hotel which means they have sloping roofs which didn't bother us in the least. Bed linen was lovely, everything was spotlessly clean. There was plenty of wardrobe and shelf space in the room, also a small safe which is free to use, just lock with the key. We could see the mountains from our window and although snow was thin on the ground, the view was beautiful. We then went for a quick nosey around the hotel, just to have a look at the pool and spa area, and also the ski locker rooms.Due to the lack of snow in Kranjska Gora during our stay, Crystal coached us to Kravavec every day to ski so sadly we can't comment on the skiing in the resort. However, the snow arrived the day we were leaving and the slopes looked terrific.The hotel is relatively close to town, a lovely level walk, and lots of little shops and restaurants as well as the small wooden chalets which often have local market traders. Over the Christmas period, it was magical. The lights and decorations were stunning, and the quality of the goods on sale terrific. One of the things I'll take away with me from Slovenia is the beauty of the scenery and the colours of the skies in the early evening, absolutely breath-taking.In the hotel, to use the swimming pool, we needed to leave a deposit and obtain an armband to enter the pool area, all pretty simple. The pool area was again spotlessly clean. The main pool was too cold for me (my one and only complaint of the whole holiday, but not really a bother). The smaller pool was much warmer and also had jets at the side which came on intermittently so you could sit and have a bit of a back massage, bliss. The jacuzzi was also lovely.The ski locker rooms were in the basement and again, a deposit was left at reception in return for a key. All very straightforward, with steps directly out of the basement area to the front of the hotel.The food was terrific. Breakfast was a huge assortment - cereals, fruits, yoghurts, breads, croissants, cold meats and cheeses, hot food (hot dog-type sausages, bacon, scrambled egg, a ratatouille sort of dish) plus also a hot plate if you wanted an omelette or fried egg or whatever. Also teas, coffees and fruit juices. Plenty of choice and always beautifully presented.Dinner's menu changed every evening and the hotel put a board up outside the restaurant so you can check after skiing what's on the menu for the evening. The list is in Slovenian and English. Typically there was a huge salad bar with a wide array of food, a starters area which usually had 3 or 4 different starter dishes, plus usually one or two soups to choose from too. Then a main serving area with four or five different main courses - lasagne, spaghetti bolognaise, turkey, beef, pork, vegetarian, local dishes, plus lots more I can't even remember, and a host of different vegetable dishes, rices, potatoes etc. Finally a dessert area, with a range of sweets, cakes and yoghurts.On Christmas Eve, it was the Christmas Festive Menu which was superb.I would like to totally recommend the restaurant and its staff, the waiters and waitresses were first class, really chatty and very friendly. They did everything they could to help and to make dining a pleasurable experience. Plates were cleared promptly and they were always in evidence if you needed more drinks. The term for thank-you in Slovenian, is 'hvala' pronouced a bit like the French voila and which we used profusely to the amusement of the waiters.We had received a 50 euro credit for each of our two rooms, making 100 euro for us to spend between the four of us over the week and we didn't manage to spend it all. We had wine most evenings, occasional spirits, lots of drinks for the kids too. On the table each evening there was a drinks menu which had special offers on it. Have a look every evening as the drinks on offer change. Typically the bottles of wine were about 7-8 euro. Beers about 3 euro. A large carton of fruit juice 2-3 euros (which you could take to your room and bring again next evening). Soft drinks 1-2 euros. I reckoned these prices to be very good indeed.Overall (before you fall asleep reading all this...!) it was a terrific stay and we are hoping to visit again. I'd highly recommend this hotel to everyone. While we were there, there were lots and lots of families (great for ski school as my kids made friends with others in the hotel and then they would be in ski school together too), and lots of singles and couples too. A great place to stay :-);Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Lovely friendly hotel!;5;10.01.2015;We booked a trip through Crystal Ski holidays to stay at hotel Lek. After reading some of the reviews on here we were not sure how good the hotel and meals etc would be. Thankfully we were very pleasantly surprised. The staff were very friendly and helpful. When on of us had a ripped salopettes incident and asked where we could buy thread in town the receptionist had a whole drawer full and helped to colour match it. The room was very clean and we felt spacious enough for the four of us (but we were in a five person room) It was cleaned with clean towels etc everyday to a very high standard. We had views of the entire village from our window. The food was plentiful, varied and of a high quality - certainly better than we expected for the price. For breakfast there were various breads, a full cooked option with staff waiting to cook eggs and ham to your preference which we didn't use as there was so much already on offer. A full continental selection, various cereals, fruit yoghurts a coffee machine which gave various options and plenty of juice too. Dinner was from 7-9 and again was great - we always found something for all of us including our slightly fussy kids! It consisted of a selection of cold starters including things like smoked salmon, hams, couscous salads etc it varied every night. There was always a pasta option for kids/vegetarians. The hot meals always included a fish option (which I never tried seeing as we were not near the sea) but also two other options with various sides, two soups every night and a salad bar too. Then there were the puddings... always at least three options of little lovely puddings they were great! Drinks were not included but every night there was a different offer with wines at around L7 and beers L2 and a kids offer too. The hotel is less than 5 mins walk from the ski slopes from the ski room at the bottom. We managed it with two kids in time for ski school every morning. The pool facilities were good, the pool is only about 10 metres but we had done enough exercise on the slopes not to really care about it. There are a couple of bubble pools too which were nice. My husband used the sauna (L7 to use) in which you have to be prepared for full on continental nakedness but he said it was very good too with different types of sauna.All in all a a very pleasant stay and if we are ever to go back to Kranjska Gora we would definitely look at staying there.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Clean room and good food;4;5.01.2015;Just returned from a week's skiing (thankfully it started snowing the day arrived). Dinner had finished when arrived but a plate of cold cuts, bread and a drink of schnapps was laid out ready, which was a welcome touch. Room was on the top floor with a lovely view over the town. Room was a good size, with 2 single beds, plenty of cupboard space, mini bar and in-room safe was available. Shower was a little small, but did the job well enough.Staff were helpful and very friendly (as was the case with all the Slovenians I met). Food was fantastic and plentiful. It was a little regimented, as having to use the same table for all meals, but it also meant, knew the table was available for when you wanted to eat.The only complaint was the level of service in the restaurant on New Year's Eve. When I'd booked with Crystal had decided not to go to the Gala Dinner. Only one member of waiting staff available, making everybody feel like second class citizens for not going to the gala dinner, she practically told me off for ordering a cappuccino.Hotel has a ski room, with lockers to rent for €5 deposit. Only takes around 5 to 10 minutes to get to the slops and town centre. Wifi was available throughout the hotel and free for 168 hours.The bar was fairly small and tended to get very busy.Will definitely be returning, as a base for cycling around the mountains.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
In need of upgrade;3;26.10.2014;Arrived here for a holiday and the first room that I was allocated the lights did not work after a few trips to reception I was moved to another room where the lights except for entrance hall worked. The room was small and had to resort to moving tv and phone placing a towel on work top so that I could get space to open case ( other alternative was to use the bed). The whole room needs updating and if visiting when using the shower beware that it is very easy to hit the temperature control Was glad that I was only spending a few nights here and that was only for approx 4-5 hours a night;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Nice and clean, good food, but overall very elementary;3;16.10.2014;1. Traveled in a tourist group2. Hotel and rooms are clean, though basic and elementary3. No air-conditioning4. Bathroom (and shower) very small5. Several obstacles and stairs (despite the elevator) to rooms, that make it uncomfortable with luggage. No safe in rooms.6. Food was high quality, and decently & nicely served7. Water at the tables was at extra money (THREE EUROS) - intriguing !!!;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Autumn break;4;29.09.2014;The hotel reception staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. The room was a good size. A big bonus was a swimming pool, that was larger than expected. Treatments were also available. Food was good, staff were very friendly in dining room.Would really recommend it.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Lovely hotel in scenic national park;5;8.09.2014;Visited this hotel on a motorbike trip. The hotel is very modern with spacious well kept rooms and has an indoor pool the breakfast and meals were excellent and the staff very friendly (as we found was everyone we met in Slovenia) beautiful scenery and great for walkers, cyclists and terrific motorcycling. I've no doubt we will return whilst everything is still excellent value for money;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Motorycle Tour;3;8.09.2014;We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights as part of an organised motorycler tour. There is no covered bike parking however we had no issues with any of our bikes and luggage.This is a Hotel used by lots of Walkers and by Thompsons for the UK so it has good standards in the buffet restaurant and the downstairs bar. The beer is cheap at 2.20 Euros and the wine at 8.00 Euros is a bargain. Look for the special drinks offers during dinner as these can be very cheap.The downstairs bar is small but clean with a nice outdoor seating area, beware last orders are at 22:00 (10:00pm). We did not use the pool but the reports we heard was that it was very good. The rooms are huge and the one we had also had a very nice balcony. They will ask to keep your passport overnight when you first arrive so thay can enter your details onto their records and we got ours back the next morning.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Comfort in the Julian Alps;4;3.09.2014;I stayed in the Hotel Lek while on a hill walking trip with seven others. We did not choose the hotel as it was cheaper to organise the trip through Crystal Holidays, part of the Thomson Travel group. We flew into Salzburg, which meant a three hour bus trip. The hotel is very nice and very comfortable. We all had rooms in the eaves, which meant that there was no view or no balcony, as the window was a skylight. This was not a problem, as we spent little time in the room. The food (half board) was very good, with choices in the buffet to suit every palate. There is a very nice bar downstairs and an outdoor bar at the tennis courts at the rear. There is also a swimming pool, although I didn't avail of it. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the hotel is a short walk from the town centre.The wi-fi is free to guests and easily accessible. Kranjska Gora is well suited to walking activities, with well marked walks to suit every ability. Ask at the Tourist Office, where the staff are very helpful.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
We loved this hotel!;5;27.08.2014;After reading all the reviews prior to our holiday we were overjoyed to find this hotel perfect for our stay. Yes, our small eaves rooms were a bit on the small (!) size but we soon got used to them (who spends ages in their room on holiday anyway?), and there is a knack to getting the shower screen not to leak, but the rooms are more than fine. We thought the staff were lovely, always pleasant and cheerful (even when we bumped into one of them in the supermarket!), our dirty dishes were always whisked away at a good time, drinks always arrived promptly, food served fine, rooms cleaned fine. The food is brilliant, loads of choice (even though we are vegetarian), loads of different salads and fruit, always seemed nice and fresh. If anything, there was too much choice, we always went to sleep with overfull tummies! We loved the drink 'specials' - we always chose the lagers, all of them were good and it gave us chance to try something different. Pool was super for rainy days or just to chill out, temperature always good and everywhere clean and tidy. Play area was closed, so that was disappointing, as was the wire fence around it (that isn't on the hotel photos). After reading many of the reviews I do think people are over fussy and need to relax and go with flow! Thanks for a super hol!;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Do not stay here...;2;19.08.2014;I stayed here for 2 nights recently with my girlfriend and my parents. We went for their 40th wedding anniversary, and this is the hotel that they stayed in exactly 40 years ago. Having requested some special arrangements on arrival we received nothing short of terrible service. Not because the sparking wine that we ordered was warm, but because the older man on the front desk was extremely rude and couldnt wait for us to leave.The hotel in general looks like it came from the 70s - and smells the same.The standard room that we had was shocking, and worth no where near the €150 per night that we paid. There are far nicer locations in the town to be found, so please pass on this one.four stars **** no way!;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Ok hotel in a beautiful walker/biker resort;3;19.08.2014;Nice stay. Reception was excellent on arrival and throughout. Staff were all friendly and helpful. Get a superior room or you'll regret it! People said the eve rooms were hot and noisy and if it rained very noisy. Our room was large enough and well furnished with a load of hanging and drawer space. Decent patio and reasonable view from the first floor. A couple in an end ground floor had limited storage space. Twin beds. The shower was good and hot and nearly made up for there being no bath. Food was 3/5, sometimes 4, sometimes 2. Breakfast was ok and never changed - find the things you like and have them every day. Juice (sometimes watered down), cereals, fruit, cheese and meats, croissant or hot breakfast. The omelette bar was seldom manned or used, maybe because they just chucked egg mix in and put a lid on. Every night was different on an evening and they had theme nights - Slovenian, Italian, European. Soup was generally a good choice. Usually a good wide choice if you had a salad. Main meals were extremely variable. Meat quality varied from good to poor. Overcooked veg. Sometimes you found one or more nice sweets, sometimes none. You could always have fresh fruit and ice cream or biscuits and cheese. Drinks were intriguing. Different wines and beers were offered each night with wine (no rose) at odd prices ranging from say 6.66 to 10.33. They varied in quality and price was no guide. Some guests asked for a glass and got a small expensive bottle - one guest had to stubbornly hold out for just a glass of wine from the bar. Easy to walk to or around town and when the weather is ok there's usually some interesting entertainment on. When it's cold or wet everything seems to stop or be cancelled - in fact, where do all the tourists go when it rains? Strange as you'd expect them to be used to bad weather! The pool was ok. Decent size and the air was warm, so good if the weather is poor. Sometimes the jacuzzi was cold and sometimes warm, strange. The pool was cool. The bar was ok. Inghams guests got free schnapps and a packed lunch. With Crystal we got €200 credit for drinks which worked out really well. This is a beautiful great base from which to do things. We walked and cycled a lot. The local map is very useful at €6.50. The ratings of easy to hard are correct. As casual walkers who do up to 7 miles the difficult ones were a bit vertical on scree for us, but we found lots of nice walks on the hills and in the valleys. Walking trainers were adequate enough. We bought a recommended book on walks and scrambles and found it was more for the serious enthusiast. If you're staying a fortnight I'd recommend hiring a car - we booked ours before going, at a much cheaper price. Much better and cheaper than the trips. We really enjoyed our stay here but be prepared for variable weather. At least a cagoule and brolly.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Excellent hotel;5;7.08.2014;We were happy to spend holidays again in this excellent hotel (for the fourth time). Why again Lek? Because it is the best hotel in Gorenjska region and the best 4**** hotel in Slovenia. The hotel has its heart and soul. Delicious food (Mediterranean cuisine on 1 August won), very friendly staff with a personal approach, great wellness centre ... Everything is on the highest level. Will definitely come back.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
stunning location;5;26.07.2014;purchased this weeks holiday from secret escapes staying 16-23 july14 - L374 for bed, breakfast, packed lunch, evening meal and snapps.this is a 4* inghams hotel in a excellent location close to Austrian/Italian bordersWe don,t do trips out, though from feedback our fellow guests thought they were good value for scenic and informative.Food was plentiful with lots of options and feel you would have to be seriously fussy not to enjoy.Wine in the restaurant ranged from 6 euros to 8 - red and white wine which varies each night with specials (as does the exchange rates) in truth for us Slovenian reds are not a great taste and we found the same in supermarkets they ranged from 1.75 e to 5e a bottle but it was difficult to tell the difference in quality based on price.After several nights in the restaurant being disappointed at the reds sat night was Chilean night and bingo a lovely bottle round 7 euro 77 (around 6 pounds 30) - by arrangement with the manager we ordered for the rest of week though due to exchange rate it varied from 6 pounds to 7 pounds hardly fleecing us and on that basis we enjoyed 2 most nights.Hotel is extremely clean and noticed all the time cleaning and tending to grounds/flowers etc - pool, spa area was a L10 euro deposit - clean, whirlpool Jacuzzi works each 15 mins jet wise and also has 6 or so pummelling stations within spa area that you could lie in at no additional costalso on a sporadic timer - they did open doors so you could sunbathe outside, shower then cool down in pool.Area rep for inghams is katya - what a gem Slovenian passionate about her country, showed up on time for her surgery hours, local knowledge invaluable and didn,t push for sales, just helpful, friendly and never in a rush even at the airport home (no cut and run - saw flight checkin) a credit to her profession.Local area so much in walking and cycle distance, we prefer to cycle - got great town bikes from Monarh - next to Merchtor supermartket and Chinese bottom end of town at L10 euros aday - most are L14 - they even have bags on front of bikes for drinks etc and lent us a bike lock - we cycled to Italian lakes around 5 miles (last 400mtr fairly steep climb) - cycled to lake bled, around 30miles each way( along D2 cycle track which is mostly flat covering Slovenia/Italy and Austria borders - just keep checking signs as they are not very well signposted for turnoffs) - lake bled had some steepish climbs and one 18% but all in all manageable if you cycle - lake bled stunning not a rip off - take your bathers as lovely and warm even had a merchtor supermarket at far side of lake same prices as kranjska so no tourist hikes (you could do this trip by local bus alow cost - think they did a trip around L35 euros via inghams incl castle entry)beautiful scenery and too many walks at different grades - use a chairlift around 8 euros to get up 1 st in kranjska (easy to walk up if your feeling fit) lots of walks off here varying difficulties or just take the toboggan down looked steep but saw anything from aged 8 to 78 using it!If you are up for it or just plain nuts you can try and swim in the many lakes fed from the mountains (these are not lake bled temperatures so don,t be fooled by locals taking a dip!) so cold your feet are screaming in secondsMy mad husband wanted to cycle up Vrsic which at 1,611 mtrs is the highest mountain pass in Slovenia (yes town bikes / trainers and no clip ins - pleased to say we did it but if you read up 24 bends each bend with granite pebbles ) a must if your a cyclist or just madder than trying to swim in a ice cold lake! - oh and at the top we had a coffee at 1 euro 20 - beer at L2 euro captive market but still no advantage taken.Too many tales and not wishing to bore the pants off anyone - Kranjska gora , great value, people so friendly, no rip offs, clean, amazing scenery, borders with Italy,hungary, Croatia , Austria can visit all within a day even venice! - enjoy;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Very good hotel;4;26.07.2014;We have just spent a week at the Hotel Lex, the staff were very friendly, breakfast very good, dinner was as you would expect for a 4 star. The pack lunch was the same every day, but it was a good cheese and ham sandwich for which we were grateful for on the walks. The pool and spa was excellent. We did the guided walks organised by the tour operator, the guide was very informative and friendly he would walk at your 'pace''. The village had entertainment on most nights which was as good as apres ski! worth the walk after dinner. Overall an excellent holiday.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Great Holiday;5;20.07.2014;The hotel is set at the edge of the village amidst stunning mountain scenery. The superior room we had booked was large and very comfortable and well worth paying the extra. The food at both breakfast and dinner was very good. There was a large choice from the hot and cold buffets and staff constantly replenished the plates. Each evening there was a choice of wine, beer or soft drink at a very reduced price. Usually between 5-8 euros for a bottle of wine. Every member of staff we spoke to was pleasant and did everything possible to ensure you had a good stay. Everyone was smiling and spoke very good English. We couldn't fault our stay. The town is fairly small but has a number of bars and hotels. However we were there to walk and enjoy the stunning scenery. The Tourist Information office sells walking maps showing the numbered trails which are very easy to follow and there are numerous cycle routes. The local buses are also very useful if you wish to start a walk from a more distant point.

A week's walking holiday;4;24.06.2014;"Good hotel, stayed in superior room on back (1st floor), less of a view but lovely and quiet (the other side overlooks tennis courts) and had a balcony. Excellent room, lots of storage, and very recently refurbished.Dinner was \samey\"", buffet style but we ate out 3 times. Generally a good standard. Easy walk into the old town. Staff very helpful and friendly. Try to speak a little Slovenian, even if it's only Good day (Dobro Dan).

Mostly very good;4;14.06.2014;We stayed in a superior room which had a separate spacious shower room & toilet with a powerful shower. There is a small passageway leading to the bedroom with two big wardrobes (plenty of hangers), and cupboard space behind the mirror There's also plenty of space for luggage. The bedroom is spacious, and there is also a spacious balcony.The staff were friendly and helpful an most spoke adequate to very good English. There is a good indoor swimming pool / health centre. A big dining room, outside terraces and balconies, and a downstairs bar and cafe. (Closes at 2200, though.)The minor disappointment was the buffet food - plenty of it and a good choice, but exposed perhaps too long on the serving counters.Well placed on the edge of the town and adjacent to tennis courts.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Spotlessly clean but disappointing dinners;3;30.05.2014;This hotel is in a fantastic location with beautiful mountain views and convenient for all local amenities . Hotel staff were friendly and helpful . The hotel was spotlessly clean and rooms were beautifully serviced daily. Beds were very comfortable. Bedroom and bathroom were quite spacious.Food wise Buffet breakfast was fine with plenty of choice but it was all self service and tea and coffee was from a machine rather than served at the table which was not what you expect from a 4 star hotel. Evening meals were disappointing hot food was only tepid and often rather dried out. Salad was fine but I'm sure the veg was frozen rather than fresh. Dinner was rather school dinner like . Wine in the restaurant was good and very reasonably priced but the hotel would not serve tap water telling us it was against regulations (water in the rooms was ok to drink). If like us you have an eaves room the lift only goes to the first floor leaving a couple of flights of stairs to carry cases up and down ,there are also stairs up to the front door of the hotel and stairs from the reception to the lift. There were some strange rules , you could not take drinks from the hotel bar to the restaurant ,you could not buy wine by the glass in the restaurant and the same bottle of wine in the bar cost more than double the price charged in the restaurant. We stayed a week and on the last evening ate in the town . Twice during our stay two different coach parties arrived and stayed just one night on a b&b basis. This would be a good place for a stopover for large parties and was obviously a regular coach stop but it meant a busy breakfast room and a queue for the coffee machine.I didn't use the pool or jacuzzi but reports from friends who did were very positive.I would happily return to kranjska gora but would not stay at this hotel due to the food.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Beautiful Kranjska Gora;4;26.05.2014;Just returned from a relaxing week at the Hotel Lek. The hotel is spotless and the staff are genuinely nice, they really made a difference from a good holiday to a really good holiday. Breakfast was good with something for all tastes from bacon and eggs, omelettes cooked to order, cereal, fruit, yoghurt etc etc. Dinner not so good some strange combinations of food, but salad and soup was ok for a week. Just a few minor gripes our bathroom was very small, we were in an eaves room. Unfortunately did have to complain about the noise that the staff made from about 11pm to 2am most nights (our room was situated above the wheelie bins) then the bread van arrived at 5.30 every morning, so we were woken yet again by the noise he made. The man on reception was not very helpful when I complained , he said that we should ring reception when we were woken, don't feel this would have been much good as the work would still have had to go on I asked to be moved to a quieter room but was told that the hotel was full, which it clearly wasn't. On the whole though we had a good time and would definitely return to the Hote Lek but would upgrade to a better room, we asked if we could upgrade when we first arrived (we were quite happy to pay) but we were told that the hotel was full, it wasn't there were only 6 guests in the whole place for dinner that evening.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Bikers Tour;4;19.05.2014;Stayed hear again with MSL Tours, fourth year I've been here and it's still good for a couple of nights. Good rooms although floor layout can be a bit confusing. Ample breakfast and buffet evening meal whilst good value has not always been well presented. Plenty of choice to eat within a 5 minute walk.Good choice of ride outs on local roads, trip to Lake Bled is a must, road outside the hotel goes up about 25 cobbled hairpins to some great quiet roads. Great base for a few days.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Great value hotel;4;27.03.2014;"Situated towards the outskirts of the town, but only a 5 or 6 minute walk from the slopes. My party had the \budget\"" attic bedrooms, which were small and basic, but adequate and always clean. One of the bathrooms had a curtain on the shower rather than a door, which meant the bathroom floor flooded each time we took a shower - but that was the only problem we had.Staff were very friendly and helpful, especially in the dining room. Food was fairly basic but tasty enough, with a choice of two meats and a fish dish each evening, as well as a good salad bar. Eggs and omelettes can be cooked to order at breakfast, which is great.Wine and beer were reasonably priced also. Especially on the \""specials\"" menu where imported wine (Chilean, South African, Spanish) was around 8 Euros a bottle. We booked our holiday early and each got a 50 euro drinks credit - we came nowhere near spending it!The hotel has a decent sized swimming pool, with a separate children's pool and Jacuzzi A sauna was available at an extra charge (8 euros pp I think).""";Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Great hotel;5;19.03.2014;We were returning visitors, travelling independantly this year having come with a package holiday in 2013. The hotel is very family friendly, the staff so welcoming to the children (aged 5 and 9). The buffet breakfast and dinner are both plentiful, with a large variety such that there was always something that the fussiest eater would like. The pool is a welcome addition for helping pass the time when the children are unable to ski all day, and a great way to unwind. There is a kids club on week nights for a couple of hours ahead of dinner which gave the adults a short time to unwind too. All in all, an excellent hotel in a lovely ski resort.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Excellent Ski Trip;5;16.03.2014;This was our families first ski trip, I would definitely recommend Slovenia and the hotel Lek, ski instructors at inter sport Bernick were fantastic very good with my boys age 7 and 9 even with me and my wife first time adults lol. The hotel was less than 5 mins from ski school when you found the short cut ask the reps! We travelled with Crystal who were fantastic we booked full package so everything was included we even booked a huskey dog trip which was also a fantastic experience.The hotel was excellent very clean with rooms fine for a week, food and drink were great, both breakfast and dinner, something for everyone. One thing we found great was the pool as the pistes close at 4pm and dinner is not till 7pm so the pool is great to keep the kids entertained and the whirlpool bath is great for the parents aching muscles lol.If I was to have one minor issue it would be the fact that dinner starts at 7 finishing at 9 meaning night skiing is difficult as the lifts are open 7-10, we done it once but to squeeze in dinner and skiing by the time you change etc is very tight, especially with the children, it would be great if dinner started at 6 as 7 is also quite late with families with tired smaller children.We loved it that much, learnt so much have rebooked same hotel for the 21st Feb in 2015 - cant wait!!!;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594

Great Hotel, great staff;5;10.03.2014;"Stayed with Crystal and had a 5* Holiday at a 2* price. The hotel is exceptionally clean and the staff very friendly. There is a leisure club with two pools, which is again very clean. During the ski season the pool gets quite busy around 5pm with families. The food is very good and all local fare, so if you're looking for fish and chips or chicken nuggets for the kids forget it. Dinner is a little late if you've got a young family who have been skiing all day - the kids were usually famished by dinner time. The rooms are clean and well presented. The only negative points are that the third bed is a bed settee and the mattress was quite hard. The shower in the room came out in a high velocity fine spray that seemed to sting and my daughter found it too uncomfortable to shower, but she was quite happy using the shower at the pool.These are minor points, and providing you are a \When in Rome...\"" type person it is not far off perfect!""";Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Great family location;5;9.03.2014;Definitely a good place to stay. We stayed here for our 1st family ski holiday - with a 6 and 3 year old plus a 6 week old baby. The hotel staff were accommodating and very friendly always making a fuss of the children. As a family though be aware dinner is served from 7pm to 9pm, so we found nibbles were necessary to keep ours going. Pushchairs aren't allowed in the dining room, this wasn't a problem as we had a detachable carry cot which our baby lay in whilst we ate. It is more of a 10 minute walk to the slopes with children in tow but ours mainly found it fine, although the occasional up on shoulders was needed for our 3 year old. We had 2 separate rooms next to each other which worked well as we brought a monitor so could put kids down and sit. Food was very good, always plenty of choice and always something the children would eat, though more choice of cereal would have helped our fussy breakfast eater!! The drinks were very reasonably priced and a great selection for the whole family which was a relief since we found ourselves in the coffee room in the afternoon every day. The kids club with Franja was excellent, she had a variety of different activities planned and toys out if the kids didn't want to join in - though ours loved everything they did! The swimming pool facilities were very good, with something for everyone and we were in everyday. Overall a brilliant stay and we would definitely return ourselves and recommend to other families.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Another great stay at the Lek;5;5.03.2014;Another stay at the Lek for our two daughters (8 & 4), my wife and myself. Booked again through thomson.Staff were helpfull and friendly and I cannot really find any fault with anything that the hotel provided.My only small concern was that when we booked we were given 50 euro credit for my wife and myself to spend at the hotel during our weeks stay, but what was not clear from the start was that it was only for use during dinner and only food and hot drinks at the bar could be booked to it, this resulted in us having approx 40 euros left that we didn't spend but a 30 something euro bill to pay!.Allways hot in the hotel so you will need to adjust the thermostate and open the windows and allways loads of hot water.We are looking to book again for next season and will have no problems in returning to this Hotel.We stayed her from 22.02.2014 to 01.03.2014 and had fabulous conditions with loads of snow and bright blue sky!!;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Super hotel, lovely staff;5;12.02.2014;We recently stayed at the Lek for a weeks skiing holiday. Keeping our expenditure to the minimum we choose eaves rooms for ourselves and our family. Although they did have a limited view, we found these rooms spacious and comfortable, finished to a good standard and with good facilities.As our daughter in law found that she was pregnant after we had booked, we contacted the hotel to see if she and our son could have an upgrade as she was not able to ski with us. The hotel relocated them in a really lovely room. It was even bigger than ours and had a comfortable, double sofa-bed, which would make it suitable for a small family. The best extra in their room was a large balcony overlooking the mountains. We very much appreciated this kind response to our request.The hotel is a lovely quiet location, it has a beautiful river opposite and a lake 20 minutes walk away, but is only about 5 minutes walk from the village centre and the pistes.There was a good variety of food in the restaurant, and service was efficient and very friendly. Snacks and drinks are available and prices reasonable. We would definitely return!;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
First snow holiday;4;31.01.2014;This was out first snow holiday. We decided on the hotel lek as we heard good things about the hotel. We had a long journey to get to here from Salzburg and arrived late at night but they still had some good waiting for us which was very good same when we left early the following week. We really loved the hotel location was perfect don't know where some reviewers were going saying it was out of the town it's a min 5 min stroll away.Room was perfect we went with a balcony room perfect size.Rooms very warm had to keep door open most nights but didn't bother us. Hotel had the best channels on the tv we have ever seen was great when you were tired and just wanted to relax.Hotel has free wifi which we found very fast.Staff especially were the most helpful staff we had ever seen.Our only fault was the food. Although what was there was lovely not enough selection. Don't like the staff serving it to you they either gave too much or not enough. Mornings ESP was annoying if you wanted any more of eggs they cooked them for you. It took me 5 mins one morning to get the attention of one of them 3 of them were having a chat in the kitchen. ;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Great hotel;5;29.01.2014;"Had a great stay in The LekThe snow was almost non-existant but Crystal ferried us to Vogel each day to ski, where there was snow ( over an hour each way) and of course that isn't the hotel's fault!The hotel was clean, bright and warm. The rooms were adequate, don't really need bigger seeings as all we do is fall into bed shattered at the end of each day! The beds were the best I have ever slept in in a hotel. I suffer with my back and am often in pain on \foreign\"" beds. These were firm and good quality.Mini bar in room which we emptied and used as a fridge! No balcony in our room which we'd have liked but no big deal.Shower was hot and powerful.Food is delicious. Breakfast plentiful, (no decent bacon but such is the norm abroad!) evening meal varied hot and tasty. Plenty of salads, and good choice of dessert plus ice cream and fruit each night too.Swimming pool is decent sized and has a small whirlpool and hot tub. there is also a fitness room but we were too tired to use this after two hours coach travel a day plus skiing! The pool was nice to soothe the aching limbs!Staff were helpful and friendly. Free wifi. We could pick it up in our room on the third floor! Storage place for skis. Good location if you're skiing in KG and plenty of shops nearby. All in all a fab hotel. I can highly recommend.

A great New Year stay - shame about the snow.....;5;28.01.2014;Stayed here as a family for a week between Christmas and New Year - had hoped to go skiing but unfortunately the resort had not had much snow so that was a bit limited. A lovely stay, though. Rooms were clean and comfortable, hotel staff wonderful and our breakfasts and evening meals were good. The cafe/bar also very comfortable and welcoming. Can't praise enough. We found plenty to do - lots of walking and then visited Lake Bled and Lubljiana using public transport - which was very efficient, reliable and well-priced.

Another great stay at Hotel Lek;4;15.01.2014;One of many stays at Hotel Lek - this time over Christmas. As other reviewers have mentioned, we arrived very late due to bad weather (and not helped by the ineptitude of the holiday reps) but hotel staff made our arrival very easy and pleasant. Very fast and friendly check in and then a welcome drink and a meal. As ever at hotel Lek, the staff were very friendly and helpful and make you feel very welcome.Hotel facilities are very good - great pool and a comfortable bar (though I would prefer fewer scented candles). It is by far the cleanest hotel I have ever stayed in. Our room was a a good size - though the mattress was a little thin. There is a wide variety of food inthe restaurant and the wine offers are excellent. Good selection of Slovenian wine at very reasonable (6-8 Euro a bottle) prices.Good value, good facilities, great staff - what more could you ask for from a hotel?;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Christmas at the Lek, Kransjka Gora;5;9.01.2014;Fantastic hotel, from the greeting we received on arrival with food and restaurant open for us at approx 1am in the morning after a horrific flight and transfer. I do have to say once again I have ground Crystal ski to be absolutely crap after we were diverted to hamburg, kept in baggage collection for four hours as approx 100 plus people have missing luggage, herded onto coaches, transferred to Austria, switched coaches for transfer to kransjka gora, stopped midway for rest break to find relief driver not turned up on time and original driver out of his taco time.Throughout our stay we found the hotel staff to be wonderful and welcoming, the food was excellent with something for everyone both morning and evening. I counted 15 different types of tea bags available at the breakfast service. The serving staff were most pleasant and you didn't get the impression they were just after tips, they are just very genuine and nice people. My son loved going to the pool after skiing and he spent many a happy hour in the 2 different pools (spa pool and separate swimming pool). Pool area very clean and plenty of loungers around the pool area, nothing nicer than laying there and looking at the beautiful mountains.The rooms are immaculate although ours was rather small but they are ok for a week, very warm and there was always plenty of hot water.The hotel owner was always on hand and always came round the restaurant of an evening with treats for the kids, again a nice little touch from a genuinely nice man.A thoroughly enjoyable holiday and a wonderful way to spend Christmas.A big thank you to all at the hotel Lek, we do wish we could have stayed for the new year as well.Anyone reading this who works for the hotel lek, we wish you all the very best for you and your families for the new year, .;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Christmas visit;5;5.01.2014;My partner had been to this hotel as a young boy years ago and so a trip back seemed a great idea for my first ski trip.The hotel were fantastic as we were very delayed and on arrival we were given a cold plated up dinner as we missed the evening meal. It was lovely.The hotel was the most clean I have seen in a long time. Despite there being plenty of kids about, our room was so quite it was perfect. The facilities are great although hot tub could be warmer. Food was glorious and staff were really friendly.

Almost perfect four-star hotel;4;26.12.2013;This hotel is located in the center of Kranjska gora. It is 5 min walk from the ski slopes. If there is enough snow you can put your skies on in front of the hotel and push yourself to the slopes. The hotel is nice with a very nice swimming pool's and nice sauna center. There is a small pool for the youngest kids as well. The food is very good and varied. The room's are nice but they need a litle renovation. The only downside that I could find is a very small playroom for kids in which is usually cold and not tidy. In general the hotel should offer more to the children, specially because there are always a lot of family's with children there. Also a small comment - the prices in the bar of the hotel are more of the 5star hotel :-);Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594

Basic but OK;3;20.10.2013;I stayed at this hotel as a group arrangement booked by another. As a single I was given a fairly austere room with barely half a window up the wall. The beds were about as narrow as you could get but thankfully little time was spent in the room and more up in the mountains.The shower in the bathroom was a flood zone if you turned it on as the shower curtain did not contain the water at all. The hair dryer was a wheezy breeze and cooked my hands before it dried my hair.If you are looking for posh, this is not it. If you are looking for clean you have no worries.Breakfast is nice if you get there before the tour bus crowd, as they tend to consume the premium selections. The coffee machine they use in the breakfast room is horrid.Wi-fi is free and very good.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594

Oh, maybe one evening the \house white\"" choice wine came in a plastic bottle, hell 4.5 euros for a litre who cares !!!!!! Food choice was brilliant. Evening was three cold salady types, two different soups and usually three different mains. Also a cold salad buffet with meats, cheeses and lettuces everything!! Then there was three desserts and ice cream to choose from, or try 'em all!!!! Oink oink !!!! Morning was three choices of cereals, pancakes, toast, jam, coissants, bacon, sausages (slovenia types). Eggs cooked to order, fried, scrambled whatever you wanted. Three juices and tea and coffee. Staff in the resteraunt were brilliant. Everywhere was spotless. Room cleaned and towels changed every day. Pool and gym was accessed using a magntic wristband obtain from reception for a 10 euro deposit. Just ask. This operates the door to enter the pool area and the locker you put your stuff. Close the locker door, wait for beeps, put band on beeper thing and your locker is magically linked to band. Amazing !!! Gym was well equiped didn't use, too tired after a days walking. Beds were huge too. The insinuation you are outside the town is rubbish. You are 5 mins stroll from the centre. So nothing! Local buses were great too. Super shiney and clean coaches. 9 euros to to the capital (takes about 2 hours). Get off and then follow signs to the centre. Easy peasy. Stunning views all around the hotel too. Awesome place to go for a holiday. We loved it to bits. Did all the main walks too. Up to the ski jumps, up the mountains to where three countries meet.

We didn't want to leave!;4;3.10.2013;Room was very comfortable and spacious, very quiet with a balcony overlooking the hills at the back of the hotel. All staff made us very welcome and were friendly and helpful. There was always a good selection of food and the special menu for drinks each night were very cheap. The location was perfect, you could sit in on the terrace and look at the mountain. We had one night of rain and woke to snow on the mountains then the sun came out and it was so beautiful. There are great bike hire shops in town at 36 euros for a family of four all day and the cycle paths are brilliant. The toboggan run is great from the top of the mountain. There is a beautiful green lake only 10 min walk from the hotel. The buses are well run and frequent. I would definitely recommend this hotel to couples or families.

A well run, well kept hotel that was a pleasure to stay in.;5;18.09.2013;To be totally honest I must tell you that since the hotel was full they had to upgrade us to the best suite in the place - and we booked late through Neilsons and got a bargain! The hotel was very comfortable with good facilities - not five star but that they don't claim. Tennis courts next door not owned by them but easy to book etc - table tennis great and nice too pool. As for the dining room the staff are soooo nice and friendly and helpful etc etc the variety is excellent but it is always tepid which is a shame. This is caused by it being buffet style served out of large almost canteen style tins that just have to sit around too long. There is always a choice of a couple of different unexciting cold starter dishes , a salad buffet - predominantly quite boring but fine and a selection of dressings etc. Then there is always at least one but sometimes two soups. Two meat hot dishes plus a veggie and sometimes fish too - plus hot/warm veg etc etc. Quantities generous - you will never go hungry. Desert fresh fruit, some nights help your self ice cream and also pastries etc. Breakfast the expected cereals, yogurts, fruit cold meats and cheeses - unexciting but fresh bread and someone on hand to cook your eggs for you - and a vat of sausages etc from which to help yourself - again unexciting but generous and fine. Have a good holiday you will enjoy this place and a fab location too. Oh yes and drinks in restaurant v cheap - 10 days bill for wine almost every night plus soft drinks and/or water 90 euros all in. Sometimes the wine of the day was cheaper than the same bottle in the supermarket!;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Excellent hotel;4;17.09.2013;We used this tour for our motorcycle group and it was a firm favourite with our customers. Great location for touring the Julian Alps and into Austria. Good sized rooms, but ask for one with mountain view and better still a balcony, of which there are many. Did not use spa but looked good. Good choice of food at Buffet breakfast and dinner, but dining room is a little cramped. Friendly staff . Sensible bar prices, but closes at 10pm. Sun goes off hotel at 5pm (late august) which means it drops cold fairly quickly. Just booked again for next year!;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Gluten Free Friendly;4;8.09.2013;If you have Gluten Free needs then this is the hotel for you. We have just returned from an 11 night stay at the Hotel Lek. We had excellent service from all the staff. I have to have a gluten free diet, and once this was explained, the staff more than met my needs. There were always several gluten free options available to me morning and evening at the extensive buffet provided. The restaurant staff were always ready to explain which choices would work for me. There was lots of variety and the food was well cooked and presented. A dessert was specially made for me, different each day. I have never tasted such variety of delicious gluten free cakes before. On occasion the soup was made without items containing gluten, a portion was removed for me and then the gluten items added for the rest of the guests. They even ordered gluten free bread to provide GF packed lunch.All the hotel staff were really friendly and always ready to take time to help us out, even explaining how the bus timetable worked. The hotel pool was a good size, maybe a tad cold, but being regular swimmers that didn’t matter to us.The hotel was initially recommended to us and we wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to others or to stay there again.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Perfect location good service fine people;4;27.08.2013;Really appreciated this hotel: all praise goes to the staff. They really make your stay worthwhile by not only trying to speak as many languages as they can possible help you in, but also getting you to speak some Slovenian. The rooms are standard, the showers are too small and not exactly comfortable but the beds are great, nice terraces on the rooms. The pool is great and the fitness by far one of the better for this type of hotel, if only they had more than one running machine and some drinks. The sauna is a recommendation: great, calm, clean and sooooo relaxing. So now to the food: breakfast is ok except that I would appreciate fresh juice in stead of nectar, a wide choice for many tastes. Dinner is in buffet form also but the buffets are really nice and really well dressed. There are some great walks and cool drives in the neighborhood to do so plenty to keep you busy.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Wonderful Hotel!;5;21.08.2013;I was in Hotel Lek. I was for a first time in Kranjska Gora. The rooms were so clean and good ordered. The swimming pool was really clean and quiet. The garden was so beautiful and I made so many photos. The playground was so good made. The food was so good! I wanted to eat it all! But the price was high.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Lek Hotek in August;4;19.08.2013;The hotel is very good, you can see my ratings. it's not a 5 star hilton but it's quiet, clean and the staff is efficient and friendly. The only downsides to the hotel are 1) the evening dinner - food is mediocre to say the least 2) the elevators - there isn't one that takes from from ground level so you need to take lift your bags 11 stairs to get to the lobby and another 10 stairs to get to the elevator level (for some of the room there's a newer elevator that saves you the second flight of stairs) 3)there's no bath, only a shower (douche).;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Take Your Own Tea Bags;4;15.08.2013;"We arrived late morning at Hotel Lek, to be told our room would not be ready until 14.00. However, the lady receptionist must have seen how tired we were (we had been up since 02.45) and after sending us to the café/bar for a drink, she re-appeared soon after to say the room was ready. All the staff were extremely friendly here and spoke several languages.Our room was clean and comfortable, if a little too warm. The food was fresh and plentiful; both breakfast and dinner are buffet style. At breakfast there is hot food, eggs, bacon, and ratatouille, also pancakes, a little fresh fruit, and the usual meats, cheeses and selection of bread and rolls. You can also have freshly fried eggs if you wish. Slovenians tend to drink coffee and herbal tea, so they do not understand black tea (e.g. PG Tips). For breakfast there was a choice of about 5 herbal teas or Earl Grey. I bought some ‘normal’ tea at the supermarket. Curiously, you could get black tea in the bar downstairs at other times, although one day even this had run out. There was always a choice for dinner, and the hotel has special evenings; whilst there we had Italian, Balkan and Slovenian food; other nights it was more general. The swimming pool water is rather cool: OK if you want to do serious swimming, but there is also a spa pool which is warmer and lovely. Special towels are not provided; you need to use your room towel.This hotel is situated on the edge of the village, about 5 minutes into the centre, where there is a supermarket, a few shops and cafés, a useful Tourist Information office and a bit further there is the bus station, which is just a bus stop. The local buses are comfortable coaches with air conditioning. You pay the driver; it is best to get one-way tickets, as sometimes another bus company will run the return journey. Lake Jesna, which comprises 2 small, artificial lakes, is just a ten minute stroll from the hotel, and is a popular spot for visitors and locals. Besides lots of walking areas, other attractions include a ride across the Julian Alps (50 hair-pin bends), and the borders of Italy and Austria are only a short distance away.";Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
A walking holiday to remember!;5;11.08.2013;Hotel Lek has very friend staff always willing to help. It is located a short stroll out of town which is great to walk off dinner which is very high quality but buffet so easy to over do! There is plenty of walking strait from the door with a good variety of routes. Bear in mind that some of walks take you quite close to the edge of near vertical drops so be careful when choosing your routes if you suffer from heights (we found this was the case with the waterfall walk [route 6] and route 13). Another thing to watch out for is the signs and route guides for the set walks are often ambitious in their timings. For example (we are quite fit having climbed Kilimanjaro) many walks which state 1hr can end up taking 1 and a half hours or more so give yourself plenty of time!Our room was spacious and comfortable with the usual peculiarity on the continent of twin beds pushed together for a double. As stated the food was excellent and in the evenings a specials menu of drinks is provided be careful though as the water on this menu is a small bottle of hotel water (which is the same one you get for free if you get the free packed lunch). The hotel had a very refreshing pool and jacuzzi (deposit of 10 euros for the stay) and a sauna (7 euros per day) which included Finish and Turkish sauna's and another jacuzzi which was rejuvenating after a long walk. The hotel also has a gym and tennis courts next door. Lake Jasna was only 5 mins up the road and was a lovely change of scenery. In addition every night in the summer the town puts on an event, usually music of some sort however you should arrive early if you want to get seats!One warning and the hotel can do nothing about it, although the hotel is on the edge of town you can still hear the church bell in town, it rings every quarter of the hour and the one ring for every hour on the hour (however you quickly get used to this). The one thing that can be a nuisance is occasionally (I think only on the weekends) the bells will ring solidly for a few minutes at around 7am so some ear plugs may be in order.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Hotel Lek - recommended;4;2.08.2013;"Hotel Lek is on the quieter side (nowhere is really busy!) of Kranjska Gora - but still only 5 mins walk from the centre. Very helpful and friendly staff, the room (in the attic as booked late) was large with the twin beds & 2 large settees and was kept spotlessly clean. Pleasant swimming pool and hot-tubs; gym there but we didn't need to use it! Meals were repetitive but worthwhile: full buffet both at breakfast and dinner; breakfast (7am-10am) offered a good range of continental as well as cereals and 'full English', fruit juices/coffee on tap (bring your own tea bags); 4 course dinner (7pm-9pm) equally flexible with self-service except for main course where staff served as much as you wanted. Wine, etc. with meal is normally priced for hotel - bottle house wine from about 8 euros. After the meal everyone receives a complimentary glass of schnapps, some nights this was excellent. All day coffee/bar downstairs, coffee just 1.40(euro) in the mornings, a euro more by evening. Table tennis table was well used.Those who had booked thru Crystals were given a free packed lunch each day (repetitive but appreciated); we went on one of the free Crystal walks, excellent, the Reps are really good.Wonderful centre for walking, local bus stops just outside hotel, Jasna Lakes 5 mins. walk up the road, marked footpaths very easy to follow. Ski lift is on other side of village but still only 10 mins. walk away.";Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Stress buster;5;28.07.2013;"Just home from a 2 week holiday based in Hotel Lek. The staff, food and location were all great. Fresh omelette every morning, though loads of other choices available, a packed lunch every day you wanted it and a good choice on the buffet evening meal. We hired a car in advance just in case the weather went against us, as it happened we only got rain on one day though!We did make good use of the car though, driving is easy ( helped by the fact we also booked a sat nav). One thing to remember though is that all hire cars must have a \vignette\"" a pre paid toll charges sticker, we did not know and bought one at a local garage.....no big deal it was only 15 Euro.Prices are also better than UK and even if you are not an experienced rambler (I am not) there is enough to do.Hope this helps!""";Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594

Enjoyable stay;4;23.07.2013;We stayed here for two weeks ending on 10th July 3013. We found all the staff very courteous and friendly, the food was very good and we never had two meals that had identical dishes the fortnight we were there. Dinner was a buffet and we were impressed with the quality and the service ( the hot portion of the buffet was served from the counter), the waiters and waitresses were also friendly and efficient . Previously we have been to Austria for our walking holiday and in terms of overall enjoyment this hotel compares well with those were we have stayed in Austria. The walking was different with more forest tracks and all these factors means that we will visit Slovenia again and if we return to Kranjska Gora we shall stay in the same hotel!;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Great hotel in Slovenia;5;21.07.2013;Just returned from a week hiking and cycling in Kranjska Gora and hotel was a delight. Lovely and clean, staff very friendly and great food. A bottle of wine at dinner averaged a stunning €8. Opt for a room with a balcony as other rooms are very small, so well worth any supplement. Our room was at the back of the hotel overlooking green pastures, nice and quiet.

Spotlessly clean, with good food and friendly staff;5;13.07.2013;We've just returned from 10 days at the Lek through Inghams and had a really good stay. The hotel is well kept, comfortable and staffed by genuinely friendly English speaking staff. The food is a little repetative if you're there for more than a week, but there's plenty to choose from and it's all good quality and freshly prepared. The bar prices are very reasonable too. Our only gripe was that we had an eaves room, which was a bit too warm at night, so I'd advise going for something larger with bigger opening windows.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Julian Alps in June.;5;29.06.2013;We have just returned from a fortnight in Slovenia, our 5th. visit to this country and our 4th. to Hotel Lek.The Lek is situated high in the pretty village and is within easy walking distance of Lake Jasna, Rouska Capella and the village of Podkoran (where Sir Humphrey Davy lived for a time).There are numerous walking trails, all way-marked and ranging from easy to difficult. A 90min.easy walk brings you to the 1947 Spanish/Slovenian border.The hay meadows are one of the most beautiful sites of nature, but mowing usually begins around 12/15th June.The staff are efficient and friendly-note Robert and Yana on reception, the attic rooms are adequate and good value, the 1st. floor rooms are bigger and have a balcony.The lighting in our room was the best we have ever encountered in any hotel ever.The entire Hotel is bright, airy and spotless.The Lek does cater for children in a limited way, but is really unsuitable for young families.Buffet breakfast and evening are plentiful, good quality and varied. The one small drawback is the piped music.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
The staff are to be congratulated!;5;18.06.2013;"We stayed at the Lek at the beginning of June - so no snow but wonderful walking tracks and the wild flowers were lovely. The hotel was a very pleasant surprise, spacious, clean and the buffet food excellent. Our room was not overly large but it was adequate, we would have liked a room with a small balcony looking out to the mountains but they were all booked..The swimming pool and spa pool were well maintained and very welcome at the end of a days walking or sightseeing and sitting in the spa looking out to the mountains was wonderfully relaxing. The staff could not have been more helpful, they were all very cheerful and the service was great. A small tip....try and learn a few words in Slovenien before you go, even if its just \good morning, hello, please and thank you\"" they appreciated our efforts hugely.We will look forward to a return visit to this lovely little hotel.""";Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
So good!;5;16.06.2013;I went there during a sport event, my stay was positive and pleasant, I ws totally satisfied. The hotel is on a quiet area on the border of Kranjska Gora with a beautiful view on the mountains, but the downtown is no more than 10 minutes away by foot. The structure is modern and offers all you need for a good stay. Our room was really big, equipped with modern furniture in warm colours and a simple style, everything was perfectly clean. The quality of sleep was very good, the bed was comfortable and no noises bothered us. Free wifi connection working perfectly. The staff was friendly and helpful anytime, both during our time there and during the reservation process. A great addition was the swimming pool area, located on the first floor with windows all around it, so that you can have a great view on the mountains covered with snow. There are three little pools, a rectangular one for swimming, a roundish one with warmer water and some wave effects and a relaxing, hot whirlpool. Spending some time there on a cold winter day was amazing! The swimming pools are for free, whereas at additional costs you can use the sauna. Very good price for what you get, much cheaper than other hotels of the same category in the town. I would go back there for sure.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
WONDERFUL TIME IN KRANJSKA GORA;3;15.06.2013;Kranjska Gora is a beautiful place with lots to do, you can spend the day walking, cycling and sightseeing it's a wonderful place for a holiday, so picturesque with the mountains and lakes and very friendly people. Make sure you take lots of layers as the weather can change being in the mountains, as you go further up it gets a little colder and then you come down and you're very warm again. The views are unbelievable, you will use your camera all the time, just as you think you've seen the best view another appears. I went up on the cable car, it's used for the skiers in winter and in the summer you can go up the mountain and if you wish come down on the sledge ( on a rail) brilliant experience although very high, took some amazing photos coming down. Kranjska Gora is also bikers paradise, they turned the old railway line into a bike path and it goes for miles in all directions, it is flat so you don't get too tired and you can  take in the sights a you go along and stop for a drink or two on the way. The only problem we had with our holiday was our hotel room, we chose the Hotel Lek as it was just on the outside of the village,this paid off as it was quiet except for the village clock which I think everyone who was a light sleeper could hear during the night! We travelled with Thomson and paid extra for a balcony room as we love to sit on the balcony especially mid afternoon, our balcony is described below and was a BIG disappointment to us and did spoil our holiday so make sure you ask questions when booking as we were not told by Thomson that there were different choices, had we known we would have chosen better. The hotel also hosted a conference on Friday 7th June the outside restaurant balcony and the below open bar area was taken over by these guests so we could not use these places to sit with a quiet drink and was pushed out to find another venue for the day, Saturday 8th was the same this was the day we were going home but not until the afternoon again we had nowhere to sit and had walk into the village, this really did bother us because we just wanted to chill by the hotel until our transport arrived. Please check with the hotel if you are thinking of booking, we met a couple who said there had been a wedding reception two weeks before and they were kept awake until the early hours as we were kept awake until 1pm! Our negative points are outnumbered by our positive so please go and have a wonderful time.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594

Fantastic hotel.;5;17.03.2013;"I stayed in the Hotel Lek for a ski trip in mid January and enjoyed every minute of my stay. Friendly staff, good food, excellent facilities. There are a couple of hotels in the resort which are closer to the slopes but if you don't mind a 5-10 minute walk it's perfect. It's a little cheaper than the others for this reason.Every night I looked forward to dinner and was never disappointed; excellent range of choices and you could visit the buffet as often as you liked.The gym & pools are great for loosening up the joints after a day on the slopes.Lots of the guests were repeat visitors and on very good terms with the staff; health & finances permitting I'll be back next year!";Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594

Highly Recommended;4;5.03.2013;The hotel is very clean, staff are more than friendly, it has a Bar, 24 reception, Swimming pool, Jacuzzi, Sauna(extra charge), boot room and is only 5 minutes walk from the slopes. Yes, The food in the resteraunt is a little basic, but always good quality and plenty of choice. The breakfast was excellent, with an egg chef at the ready to make you an omlette or fried eggs to your liking.We booked with Crystal and had a small room in the eaves. It was more than enough room for what we required and also had a very nice, fairly recently refurbished bathroom. To sum up, this hotel is great value. it definitely warrants the 4 stars for it's service and ammenities. It does have a couple of minor draw backs, the hotel bar closes at 10pm, far too early! and there are no tea/coffe making facilities in the room (this is normal for Slovenia though).If you are looking for a good value, clean, well maitained hotel as a base for skiing or walking in Kranjska, I can highly recommend the Hotel lek.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Not a 4 star hotel;2;2.03.2013;We booked our skiing holiday at this hotel through Kompas travel agency and are deeply unhappy. We believe this is a rip off. Our room ( in the loft) was so small that we couldn't open our suitcase, which is average size. When we complained at the reception we were offered a more spacious room which is actually for the handicapped people. It has two separete beds ( we travelled as a couple) and the bathroom is specially equipped for people with special needs. The only other possibility was to pay extra 140€ to get a standard room ( what we did), which again does not meet the standards of a 4 star hotel. It is cold (we got an extra heater later) and the bathroom is again extra small, there is no mini-bar or bathrobes. The sauna is ok although extra charged. The staff at the restaurant are very friendly, and they are hotel's most valuable resource. We felt really welcome in the restaurant. I would not recommend this hotel.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Excellent hotel for;5;23.02.2013;We are a family of 2 adults and 4 children(14-7) and we all thought this hotel was excellent. We have now stayed here twice for family ski holidays and both times the hotel staff were very friendly and spoke perfect English. Breakfast and evening meals were buffet style with enough choice to suit everyone in our group and we thought were very nice. The small pool complex was great for after ski swimming. We would recommend this resort for mixed skiing ability families and beginners.

OK, but bring your own teabags and kettle!!;3;17.02.2013;"I have just returned from a week's ski-ing holiday at Hotel Lek. Firstly, I should say that I desperately wanted to give this hotel 4 stars and dithered about it, but this just not would be an honest review if I did. There is nothing seriously wrong or sinister, it just all very mediocre and isn't what I would call a 4 star establishment. I have read many other reviews of the Lek on here, most of which are extremely complimentary, but I am afraid I have to agree with those in the 'mediocre' category. The first thing that hits one on arrival (and not in a good way) is the 1970s style decor. Our room (for myself and my two children) was a standard family room and I have to say it was pretty cramped. On entry, one was immediately struck almost dumb by the lurid orange curtains and the alarming 70s carpet and furniture. My bed was a converted sofa which involved a hard mattress on an even harder wooden bench. It was not what I would expect from a four star hotel and really was very uncomfortable. The pillows were more like empty matchbox sized pillow cases and we had one each. I had to ask for more, but really, one would need half a dozen each to achieve the effect of a single pillow back home! The bathroom was absolutely tiny although the hot towel rail was a blessing for drying wet ski gear. Finally, there is not only no kettle or tea making facilities in the room, there is no English tea available AT ALL. I don't think the Slovenians drink it.Therefore, make sure you take your travel kettle and your PG Tips if, like me, you can't live without a good brew in the morning!Undoubtedly the worst aspect of the Lek was the food. To say it is \hearty home cooking\"" is an insult to hearty home cooking. Every night was a choice of either some completely unidentifiable meat fried in some sort of breadcrumb coating or else some kind of 'stew' (again made with largely unidentifiable meat) all served up with mercilessly overboiled plain vegetables. My children, who are generally good eaters, survived on bread and ham for the entire week, whilst I persevered with the unappetising fare (for which I regard myself as deserving of a medal). The puddings largely consisted of what can only be described as unidentifiable gelatinous and unnaturally colourful 'blobs'.Our quality of sleep was very patchy as the rest of our landing was occupied by several rowdy Slovenian families who allowed their children to race up and down the corridor screaming until past 11 every night. Of course this was not the hotel's fault and they were very quick to come and deal with it when I eventually complained, but they then let themselves down by hosting a rowdy corporate function on our last night with thumping disco and folk music until the early hours, knowing full well that many of their guests had to be up at 5am to travel home.To be fair there were a number of good points too. The staff were mostly very courteous and helpful. Everyone seemed to speak English to some extent and they all obviously loved children. The place was very clean, including our room, and there was a fairly good selection of salad each night to counteract the atrocious hot dishes. Everything seemed very cheap - I only spent EUR26 in the whole week - admittedly I didn't drink any alcohol, but even so! The pool area is a real bonus, especially for the children, and is open all day. Finally the location is to die for - the view from our (small and basic) room was worth the money in itself. Although not the closest hotel to the slopes, this was not important to us and we absolutely loved waking up and looking out at the river and the mountains directly in front of us. Overall I certainly would not discourage anyone from staying at the Hotel Lek. It is all very well meaning, but the decor and the food just weren't quite up to 4 star standard, and more importantly cost, in my humble opinion.""";Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Friendly hotel and great value for money.;4;13.02.2013;"We stayed at the Hotel Lek March 2012 - a last minute 'cheap as chips' ski deal with family so we weren't sure what to expect but we were pleasantly surprised. We booked through Crystal via Co-op travel, Clifton Moor York who were very helpful. Swift flight Newcastle to Salzburg and once you get through the mayhem at Salzburg airport - you have to persevere and find a Crystal rep, there is a delightful, though very long, bus trip through the Austrian countryside stopping off at a gorgeous traditional cafe on the way. Reception at hotel are efficient and became more friendly throughout the week. Crystal were very good generally and one of the trips is a day trip to Venice (Kranska Gora is very close to the Italian border) which was wonderful, a real treat. Rooms; fine, clean, warm with modern bathrooms but the small family room my sister's family had booked was not big enough for 2 adults and 2 children so I accommodated one of their kids in our room ( I have one child); the manager did apologise but because the hotel was full there was no where to move to - The World Championships are partly held here and several of the teams were staying there including one of the world champions so there was a great atmosphere in the hotel.Food; Plenty of choice, buffet style and suited all ages from salads to pasta, soup, casserolesDrinks; reasonable prices, friendly bar downstairs and different special offers everyday at supper. I would never had tried the grapefruit lager if it hadn't been on offer at about 30p and it was really refreshing!Ski-ing; Lockers are provided and are free but we found it more convenient to pay for lockers in The Larix hotel right next to the slopes. Very family friendly area and not too many idiots on the slopes!Pool; Quite chilly so it was in for a few lengths then straight to the lovely warm whirlpool and jacuzzi. We didn't use the sauna or gym.Kranska Gora; Very picturesque village, small, quiet and not noted for its nightlife which is just what we wanted. great supermarket and amazingly cheap local food and drinks.Highly recommended if you want a three star family friendly holiday for ski ing and I will definitely return.";Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
First time skiers, very good resort and hotel!;5;11.02.2013;"It was with some mixed feelings that we had booked our first ever skiing holiday, having been talked into trying it for the first time. At 50+ it was a bit of a \leap of faith\"" for us and way out of our \""comfort zone\""! So any of you that are thinking about trying it, then we are a few weeks ahead of you, but these are our thoughts about the resort, skiing,trips and the hotel.TRANSPORT - We flew into Salzburg as is the most popular route. it then takes about 3 hours to get to Kranjska Gora, this really goes by as the scenery is fantastic! There is one stop \""en route\"" and can you believe that at this stop we bumped into the couple who persuaded us to go, who were on their way back to the airport! The route was somewhat mountainous at times, but the coach coped admirably to the resort. As the Hotel Lek is the furthest hotel out of the village (by 5 minutes)we were virtually the last people to get off. RESORT - We really enjoyed it here, the people were so friendly, and the prices in the local bars were to put it mildy CHEAP!! 1.5 euros for a 500ml bottle of beer, 3 euros for a coffee and brandy, need i say more!! Very nice place, within a week you have probably walked down every road.HOTEL - Having read previous reviews about the rooms, we did upgrade to a \""superior\"" room (112) which did overlook the front of the hotel. Plenty of room, (although the amount of clothes my partner had taken there was never going to be enough!!!) The only let down (as per previous reports!) was the bed! You only had to enter the room for the bed to start practising its \""creaks and groans!!! Seriously you couldnt even sit on it without it making all kinds of noises, this DOES need looking as it is one of very few complaints! Food, if youre a typical englishman, full english breakfast, chicken and chips then perhaps you will be disappointed, but even if youre slightly adventurous then the food is excellent, the week we were there English people were in a minority, but as this is a skiing resort, 10 minutes from the Italian border, close to Croatia and Austria, you have to accept that serving to suit the English, is not their top priority. There is always a choice of wine \""offers\"" at each evening meal, this varied in price from 8 euros a bottle to 12 euros a bottle, and varied in quality to \""drinkable\"" to lovely! Very very cheap! (My friend stopped at the Alpina and was charged 3,5 euros per very small glass, no bottle options!) Bottle of beer (500ml) from the mini bar was 1,90 euro!! Ludicrous, but great!SKI HIRE As easy as it can get, ski hire shop in town (reps will tell you where) very helpful, for the last day we exchanged our downhill skis and equipment for a go at the \""cross country\"" skiing.( If you think that this is easy think again!) SKIING Only skiing tip we can give, is that there is a short cut to the slopes, this goes from a door inside the Locker room, not ski room! It is a short walk from the Lek to the slopes (but not when youre wearing ski boots, helmet, poles and carrying skis!) but apparently the Hotel Larix (right at the bottom of the slopes) will rent a locker out for 30 euros a week, but worth it, trust me!! TRIPS - We did the dog sled, and YOU get to steer the train (?) of 3 dogs, great fun and wonderful experience, and these dogs are NOT mistreated, well worth it. Schnapps tasting, not really worth it, but you do get to meet your fellow English travellors.....Bled, beautiful trip, lovely place, well worth it.. All in all there are so many things we could comment on, nevertheless to say, we will return next year and it will be to the hotel Lek, perhaps take some WD40 with us in case they havnt got new beds!!!""";Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Would go again, no probs;5;11.02.2013;Very pleasant and helpful staff, excellent food, rooms are nice and the warmth is always there. Stayed for a week and enjoyed every bit of it, the food is buffet style and there is plenty of choice, from seafood to local cuisine. Location is just at the edge of the village so is quite central. The walking route's in the area are very close by and the skiing is visible from certain bedrooms so you are never far away from activity. Overall an excellent and enjoyable stay.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Location, location, location;3;27.01.2013;This was my 4th trip to Kranjska Gora. My review is based on the two other hotels I have stayed in in this resort.Hotel lek has a wonderful location, right on the edge of the resort and very well situated for walking. I may add I am not a skier! Travelling on my own I was given what they call an eaves room. It was compact. Double bed, TV, wardrobe, small apex window. The bathroom was a fair size with a shower, heated towel rail, hairdryer, toiletries and lovely fluffy towels.The service in the hotel was superb. All staff were very friendly and made you feel very welcome. Now Im afraid I have to start getting picky!I will start with my room, Two power points, one in the bathroom and one just inside the door at floor level. There are more if you want to start unplugging lamps etc.There was no bin in the room except the miniature pedal bin in the bathroom. If your looking for heating control look under the curtains. No fridge or tea and coffee facilities. The walls are quite thin and it got quite noisy, but that was due to some inconsiderate guests not the fault of the hotel. The swimming pool was adequate. The water was a little cool for my liking but when you got out it was nice and warm to help dry you off. The loungers didnt scream 4 star. The legs had started to rust and they were made of cheap blue and white stripey polypropylene. There was a jacuzzi which unfortunately wasn't working for a few days during my stay. There is no life guard on duty which is stated on signs around the pool.  The restaurant/dining room wascomfortable, well decorated and the seating was well laid out. Again the service was fabulous and friendly.  I am quite a picky eater so if you have a healthy appetite Im sure you will have no problems. I, however struggled with the main courses. The area around the food stations was very cramped and got congested very quickly. The main courses are not self service. There was no opportunity to peruse the available dishes at your leisure. Breakfast was adequate, however I felt that one toaster and one tea/coffee machine was not enough for the amount of people. Back to the positives. The bar is really cosy and there is a vast choice of drinks along with some snacks. Again service was great. The hotel was extremely clean and shiny! But at the same time very welcoming.  To sum it up, ask for a bigger room and if your not a fussy eater you will be just fine.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Another wonderful stay at the Hotel Lek;5;26.01.2013;We have just returned from our second stay at the Hotel Lek and were pleased we came back.The staff made us feel very welcome from our arrival and took note that we were vegetarians. It was a special birthday and me and they really did go the extra mile with my husbands requests and how they made me feel special on the day.The hotel is very clean and in good order, including the swimming area and the spa facilities.Breakfast and dinner were both good, and we left the hotel at 4:30, so they had prepared us a packed one to take away.Our room was a balcony room at the front on the second floor and was as we expected and advertised - a lovely big bathroom with a heated towel rail to sort out any wet ski gear.Everyone we spoke to at the hotel was very pleased with there stay also.The walk to the slopes only takes a couple of minutes, we brought ski carriers - a strap which made it easy to walk there and back.If we were going back to KG in winter or summer we would not hesitate to book to stay at the Hotel Lek - can't say more than that!!;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Excellent value for money, friendly hotel!;5;18.01.2013;"Just finishing a week's stay as part of a Crystal Ski package. The Hotel Lek is excellent in every way. We have been made to feel very welcome, the facilities (swimming pool, fitness room, sauna) are great, breakfast and evening meals are varied, well cooked and tasty! We were also upgraded as other Crystal guests appear to have been. Our room is large and warm with cable TV (about 40 channels including Eurosport 2), the bed is big and comfortable and the ensuite bathroom is fab with all the little luxury bottles! There is a minibar but we have tried not to use it. A selection of \special\"" alcoholic drinks is available in the restaurant every evening at very reasonable prices. We would highly recommend the Lek Hotel!""";Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Superb value for money. Perfect base for skiing.;5;14.01.2013;My husband and I went with another couple for New Year and we were not disappointed.The hotel is extremely comfortable, warm and clean. Our room was the full access room and was huge so we were quite lucky. Our friends' room was not too small even though it was advertised as an eaves room.We stayed on half board and there was a wide variety of food available, buffet style. Breakfast included continental and cooked and there was plenty of fruit, hot drinks, pastries and meats to choose from. Evening meal offered three courses and we counted around six different hot options each night, let alone the cakes and ice-cream for dessert! (If we hadn't been skiing, we'd have been our own excess baggage!) We were impressed with the effort that the hotel went to on New Year's Eve. They put on a gala dinner - 7 courses and music and we enjoyed a most entertaining evening. We all received jars of honey as gifts and a bottle of champagne per couple which we thought was very generous. We had a few drinks in the bar but this hotel is so close to the village centre where prices are cheaper so we often went out.Although we booked through Crystal Ski (via Igluski) we chose not to take their package after researching on tripadvisor as to the best ski school in this area. We signed up at the SkiSchool.Si and were not disappointed. The equipment was of a good standard, we were given this quickly and despite signing up for group lessons (I'm Intermediate, my friend was beginner) we ended up with 1:1 lessons for the same price due to everyone else learning in big groups with Crystal!! We did get our passes through Crystal to avoid queuing up - they do this for you. It is only located about 5min walk from the hotel, but do look for the back door from the locker room and head through the back of town up the Alpine as it's an easier walk.We were really impressed with the value for money and comfort that this hotel offered and very much enjoyed the whirlpool in the pool area at the end of each day to relax. (We didn't go in the Sauna)The hotel offers free wifi throughout and has ski lockers in the basement which is useful.Everyone on reception was incredibly helpful and even though we had a late arrival and departed before breakfast, they laid on platters of food for our arrival and packed a breakfast bag to take on the coach return.Overall, I'd recommend this hotel but make sure you look for the deals as the rack rates are quite high.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
cosy hotel in good location;5;9.01.2013;We booked this via Crystal. A bit concerned as to the reviews, we upgraded to a larger room with balcony.The week was just perfect! The check in was smooth, the room was facing the road and mountains, had a lovely balcony and big windows. The room was clean, comfy and warm. Infact we did sleep every night with the balcony door ajar so that we could get all that fresh mountain air in our lungs. It was quiet, no loud noises and as it was over xmas, i pitied the people who were staying near to the church as we could hear the bells on xmas day and they were loud and we must have been about 500 mtrs away. Any one staying near the church must have had no sleep that night! The bathroom was warm and plenty of hot water for each of us to have a long hot bath after a day on the slopes. We decided to leave our skis at the hotel larix for a charge of 25Euros - a bit steep but we were too lazy to carry them. its not far and if there was snow on the ground the majority of the distance is skiable but we had little snow so we used the larix.Food and service at the hotel lek was great for the price that we paid. Plenty of choice and we had a lovely table near the window so that we could really appreciate the views.We used the swimming pool once. My partner suffered from a cold afterwards but I think that was more about a cold going around than the pool itself. They hydro pool was great for relaxing the muscles and the main pool was not too busy to do a few lengths.All in all a really nice, friendly hotel and would recommend to friends.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
A Fab Time;5;30.12.2012;"We booked this skiing holiday through thomson's last feb for my wife two daughters (6 and 3) and myself and traveled with friends so there was seven of us in total. Having read some of the reviews on here about the rooms we were a little apprehensive about how ours would be and when I noticed that our room description on our first invoice said \Family Room\"" and on our final comfirmation letter which arrived in November it had changed to \""Small Family Room\"". I enquired with First Choice who we had booked with and they checked and discovered that the rooms available had changed mid way through the year so instead of the double bed pull down double and single sofa bed which we had booked we were now being put into a room with twin beds and two single sofa beds, in fairness to the staff at first choice they kept me informed and told me that we would in fact have the larger room that we had booked, I wonder if I hadn't noticed would they have put us into the small room? We took off bang on time from Bristol and thanks to a tail wind arrived 30 mins early in Salzburg. When we reported to the Crystal rep they had no record of us and what bus we should be on for our transfer, We went to their desk in the arrivals hall and were told that the bus was not yet there and could we come back in 30mins. Fair enough we all thought as we did arrive early. we had a hot chocolate and looked around the shops and returned to be told our bus was waiting for us and we could now go and get on it. When we got to the bus we were told that due to fog in Innsbruck airport 12 additional flights had been transfered to Salzburg and this had caused some problems with the scheduled flights and we should be on our way as soon as possible, TWO HOURS later we finally got on our way for the 3 1/2 hour transfer. Talking to some of the passengers that got on the bus last they had also been told to go and have a coffee when we were obviously allready waiting on the bus for them, I think the crystal reps had got very confused with the extra customers that were arriving and did not really know who was on what bus.We had a 30min stop half way through the transfer and had some drinks and a toilet break and finally arrived at the hotel at approx 11pm. The welcome that we recieved when we arrived was great with a cold platter left out as the restaurant was closed.There was no need to be worried about the room it was a lovely sized room with a bath and shower and great views of the mountains and very comfortable beds which were now much needed after a long day.We were told by our rep on the transfer that we had to go to another hotel in the morning for 08:30 to collect our lift passes and vouchers for the ski hire!!!! then a welcome meeting at 09:30 which was very informative and not the usual excuse to try and sell you some of the trips!Now we start to have some problems! we are not taken to the hire shop as we had been told but just told where it was and to go and get our gear, we found the shop and of course so had every other customer that had arrived the night before, the result was just shear mayhem and there were boots and ski's everywhere and only limited space for you to sit down and try your gear on! From there we had to get to the slopes and the meeting point for my wife's and 6 year old to have their first lesson at 12 midday, was any rep their to show us where the easiest way to the slopes was NO! so carrying three sets of skis and boots we walked up the wrong street only to have to retrace our steps and ask for directions which in fairness when you knew the way it was only a five minute walk.Lessons began and I had my 3 year old, a bag and my own ski gear and tried to find where the ski lockers on the slopes were located, problem number two. two different crystal reps telling me two totally different places resulting in me and my daughter walking back and fourth across the bottom of the slopes for about an hour. First impressions were what a wonderfull place but our first experience could have spoilt the whole trip as if I'm honest after what was a very disorganised first morning we were ready to pack up and come home! Why do crystal not stagger peoples time to collect their gear so there is not one mad rush and actually acompany there customers as was promised! If we had been shown and given some help the first impressions of the holiday would have been much better.Once you knew where you were going the resort and facilities are great and we had an amazing time!The food, Accomodation, pool and staff at the hotel lek are great and i think some of the previous reviews may have exagerated some of their problems as when we reported that a bulb had gone in our room they repaired it within a few minutes and all of the staff would make a point of saying hello and making you feel very welcome.In conclusion I would have to say that the holiday was great but I think some of the crystal organising needs to be looked at. As we only dealt with the reps on the first day I can only comment on that and unfortunatly my expierience of them was not a good one.""";Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Great hotel for vegetarians;5;29.11.2012;We stayed here for a week c/o a Crystal ski trip. The room, facilities and service were excellent we had a room with balcony and mountain views. Well laid out and clean. Staff very helpful. We are both vegetarians and the kitchen staff went out of their way to ensure that there were several different vegetarian choices available for us, in addition to selections from the very extensive buffet. The food was great - just what we needed after days of high activity. So highly recommend for a family with one or more vegetarians - but do let the hotel know in advance.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Crystal Customers Beware;5;24.11.2012;"First let me say this Hotel is really lovely with excellent facilities, location and food. BUT this is severely compromised if you are booked in with Crystal Holidays. We, and my sister and husband, booked our holiday through Crystal Holidays and we were allocated one of the older, dark tiny rooms, even though we had paid extra for superior rooms. These Rooms were classed superior only because they had a minuscule balcony. Our bed (4'6\) screeched with every movement making it impossible to sleep but this proved to be a blessing in disguise as we were moved to a different room which was faultless. Clean and bright with a large balcony, albeit no view.Having spoken to many English guests we found that all those who had booked through Crystal Holidays had inferior rooms (some in roof space with high windows) but still deemed superior but those booked through INGHAMS had the better newer rooms.I would highly recommend this a hotel but avoid booking this through CRYSTAL HOLIDAYS.""";Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Nice hotel, lovely staff;5;8.11.2012;We visited this hotel as part of a package tour through Blakan Holidays. Having read the tripadvisor reviews we paid the extra for balcony rooms and steered clear of the attic. If truth be told the upgrade wasn't a lot of money and more than worth it. Although situated on the edge of Kransjka Gora the village isn't big so it is only a short walk to the centre. Nestled amongst the Julian Alps there are some stunning views to be had and as such the location is ideal. Our room was spacious and comfortable with plenty of storage space which I guess is useful for the winter sports crowd. The bathroom didn't have a bath but was otherwise perfectly decent although the shower head had a life of its own and occasionally would fly off the bracket and soak the bathroom. Our room was at the side and didn't have particularly good views but it was close enough to reception for us to take advantage of the free wifi. We had a bit of a noise problem one night from an adjacent bedroom where a party seemed to be being held but otherwise the room was quite a relaxing place.All the hotel staff were helpful and very friendly. They all spoke English to a good or fluent standard. We were on a half board deal. The food was very good. Don't expect haute cuisine. You get a buffet which is heavy on the carbs, just what you need after a day's hiking or skiing in the mountains. Slovenian specialities and more international dishes are on offer, nothing fancy but all fresh and tasty. There was a red and a white wine on special offer each evening along with one of their range of beers. The prices were good and we availed ourselves of the offers each night. A buffet breakfast in the morning also hit the spot. Once again nothing fancy but perfectly acceptable. There is a small bar area downstairs where prices were reasonable. Other facilities include a gym, pool (a bit on the cold side) and spa.

Hotel Lek ( Kranjska Gora) 08 September 2012;4;15.10.2012;The Hotel was really good, Excellent food even though it was a buffet. They had a nightly guest beer and bottles of wine from around the globe which were fantastic value. The staff in the hotel were very friendly and efficient and could not do enough for you. The indoor pool area was great, just what you want after a long day in the mountains. The only negative about the hotel was the lack of a public lounge. The bar was in the basement and not very welcoming.We did not appreciate that the bus up to the Vrisic Pass only ran at weekends in September which was a big disappointment.. On our last day however the hotel very kindly picked us up at the Vrsic Pass on brought us back to the hotel in time to get transfer to the airport at 5pm. We had the walk of the week at high altitude. Would also recommend the cycle ride to the Italian lakes ( breathtaking).;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Making the holiday;5;17.09.2012;"Probably the best hotel in Kranjska Gora with superb mountain backdrops, excellent service and the food isn't bad either! The 'superior' room was spacey, clean and quiet and the staff always on hand to sort out any of the niggles you might be having with pretty much anything.The pool area is great with the pool itself not being massive but adequate after a good trek into the mountains; there is also a kids pool, jacuzzi and infinity pool area with sun loungers just outside and a bar just around the corner.As a summer base this was impossible to beat.";Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Just a bit from the center of Kranjska Gora;5;12.09.2012;First positive thing is that this hotel is not owned by HIT Alpinea which is automatically raising the Staff quality...all are very kind, helpfull...prices are not even high for what U get and the quality of the products they serve is really good...not only the food but drinks, wines and aperitifs-all better standard than anywhere else in Kranjska Gora. Sauna - very rarely U find it crowded...whenever I have been there I was mostly alone, from time to time some people from the swimmingpool were coming but even that is not a problem while there is really enough of space (1x infrared sauna, 3x finnish sauna, 1x turkish sauna, 1x round whirlpool, 3x showers, and if U wish U can even have a sunbath right there, drinking water available for free)...Very romantic bar in lower floor, i-net and wireless access for free, tennis field beside and walking&hiking exits are right in front of U.What else?...don´t waist your time...go there and check it by yourself!;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594

Good hotel - Great resort fora quiet summer holiday;4;4.08.2012;We stayed in room 105 for a week . The room was good but small with only a small triangular window quite high up. Apart from that no problems with the hotel. Good wide range for continental buffet breakfast with option of bacon sausage and egg (we didn't try that). Evening meal was again buffet with wide range for starter and main course. Desserts were a bit restricted although there was usually a variety of ice cream flavours on offer - again buffet style so you could take as much as you wanted. Good solid food. Drinks with meal were reasonably priced. Staff were all very pleasant and welcoming and spoke English. Plenty of places to sit and enjoy the views and the sun.

Lovely hotel in a great location;5;26.07.2012;"Stayed in this hotel for a week in July 2012 with Crystal. Stayed in a larger eves room - perfectly adequate with beautiful view over the mountains towards Lake Jasna. Main room around 20 feet long by 15 feet wide plus decent sized bathroom and wardrobes.Location of hotel good - on edge of village so not bothered as much by noise from bars and church bells which might be in village centre. However, if you think that Kranjski Gora is noisy in the summer then you are way overly sensitive.Generally plenty of choice at breakfast. Hot options are nice scrambled eggs, nice bacon and OK sausages. Huge array of cold items from meats, breads, fruit etc. All self service so can have whatever you fancy.Dinner was generally very good. If you are looking for complaints then some of the meat items were not of the highest quality, but tonnes of nice cold foods. Nightly special on drinks were good value compared to other hotels in Kranjski Gora owned by HIT Hotel group. E.g. beer 2 euro, litre of soft drink 2 euro, full bottle of wine 5 to 8 euro.. Staff all very helpful - they were there if you wanted them, but were not \in your face\"".Free access to pool area - a main pool, plus a smaller pool with jets and a small whirl pool. Generally this was quiet and if you went during they day you just about have the place to yourself.Anything to improve? Would be nice to have a coffee included in evening meal, but generally the place was great.I have stayed in other hotels in Kransjki Gora - Alpina, Larix, Prisank (all owned by the same chain - HIT hotels) and I think Lek is my favourite. Feels the most Slovenian and the least Corporate.""";Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Not 4 star food in a 4 star hotel;4;22.07.2012;"Stayed at the Lek for one week via Crystal. The hotel overall was excellent.The staff were faultless, courteous and always seemed to be happy and helpfull.The room was a nice size with plenty of space and cleaned daily without fault. We paid far an upgraded room with a balcony after reading reviews on standard \roof rooms\"" usually the norm with tour operators.The only big let down with this hotel was the way the food at evening meal was sploshed on to your plate on occassions, this to me really lowered the standard for such a nice hotel, along with lack of choice of vegetables, the food offered was a bit bland and seemed to be carb overload!Personally I like to select & serve myself, which to me would have put the hotel at the top of my stay list had this been possible.The hotel is on the edge of the village which means a 3 to 4 minute walk into the centre of Kranjska Gora which is fine as most peaple who go in summer are walkers, hikers or outdoor sporty types where a little exercise each day does not matter.""";Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
lovely hotel, beautiful location, friendly and helpful staff;5;18.07.2012;"We stayed here for two weeks and in our opinion this hotel is ideally situated for relaxing, walking and cycling. It is on the edge of the resort but only a few minutes' walk from amenities - shops, tourist information centre etc. There is a very pleasant balcony at the front of the hotel for having drinks or snacks, with wonderful views of the mountains. The staff were extremely welcoming and friendly, and spoke good English. Nothing was too much trouble for them. The hotel itself was comfortable,clean and quiet.The breakfast buffet was excellent, with cooked and cold choices, and several different types of bread. The evening buffet was good, with some themed evenings such as Italian or Slovenian,and there was always a choice of a few starters; for the main course there was always a meat, poultry, fish and vegetarian option, potatoes and a few different vegetables. The salad bar was extensive and all very fresh, and there was always fruit and a few cakes, or mousse and ice cream. We loved our table which was in a window with good views.We hope to return next year, as there are so many more walks and cycle rides than it is possible to do in two weeks. We hired our bikes from Enka Bar which is excellent and very close to the hotel, with helpful owners who give good advice on cycling in general and local trails.";Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Comfortable hotel with friendly staff;4;9.07.2012;Hotel Lek is a nice, comfortable and clean hotel in a great location: in a quiet area, a few minutes walk from the village centre and from the start of several walks (free guided walks organised by the hotel twice a week mid-june to september). The staff are very friendly and helpful (they were more than happy to suggest things to do etc) and the food is nice, especially the cold starters and desserts, the hot main courses were good but not so well presented. I stayed there for 7 nights, in an attic room, the room was comfortable, with a spacious bathroom (powerful shower). The weather was very hot (heatwave) and the room got too hot, that was the only downside of my stay.I used the swimming pool most days, nice area and again clean. I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay there again.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Friendly hotel;4;11.06.2012;"Staff very friendly and helpful. Oodles of food - cold food particularly good; hot food served canteen style so a bit mass produced and not much restaurant ambience. More food choices available when hotel full. Machine coffee at breakfast is rubbish but can get good stuff in bar.Located at edge of village so reasonably quiet but centre facilities still easily accessible. Attic room was fine except hot at night despite having windows open throughout the day. A couple we met had a 2nd floor balcony room overlooking the tennis court and complained of loud music.";Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Excellent location, friendly staff .;4;5.06.2012;Located at the base of the mountains, we had a balcony with a beautiful view of the peaks. The hotel is a few minutes walk from some amazing walks and lakes. The staff are friendly and helpful. The room size is fine with plenty of space. We made friends with another couple and they had a room in the attic and this apparently got too hot, we were on the first floor. Nice swimming pool area, food was good. Hotel needs a better reception area where you can sit and relax and have a drink. The bar is down stairs and a bit small inside. All in all a great stay for anyone who enjoys walking and the great countryside of Slovenia.

Feels like home;4;4.04.2012;The biggest quality of Hotel Lek is in very friendly and warm atmosphere. The staff is trying to break average hotel feel and after few hours you feel like home. Maybe the reason is beacuse we are Slovenian but i really recommend the stay for everybody that would like to enjoy relaxed atmosphere, tasty food (theme dinners) and excellent starting point to explore one of the most beautiful parts of Slovenia.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY - EVES ROOMS ARE FINE!;5;7.03.2012;I have to admit i was a bit panicked by the reviews of the EVES ROOMS for this hotel prior to my arrival. However the rooms for a couple are really fine! Yes they are on the smaller side but i have stayed in some absolute cupboards in France for twice the Price i paid in Kranjska Gora! The Eves rooms had a nice big powerful shower. A good size double bed under the eves and a velux window, which we had a lovely view of the Montains from! The hotel restaurant and bar and town itself are all lovely so why you would want to even spend much time in your room im not sure. Also there is Night skiing every eve so even more chance to stay out!The Hotel was impeccably clean and this was evident throughout.The staff were very helpful polite and friendly and ALWAYS made you feel very welcome. the staff, mostly locals, are a real asset to the hotel.I would class the resort as more family based but as a couple looking for a quitet relaxed ski holiday it was also perfect.There were good offers on the Wine and Beer every dinner time. Food was buffet style and wholesome tho not gormet, but i wouldnt want to pay gormet prices so much prefered this after a whole day on the slopes.Hotel is 5 mins slow walk in ski boots form the slopes, secure ski and boot dry room in cellar.Hotel pool/spa was pretty basic but very clean.The only quibble i had were the joining door between rooms was not very sound proof and we could hear next door very easily. No so bad if you know them but not when they are strangers.It would be great to have tea and coffe making facilities in the room for us Tea additcted Brits.Will definatley be coming back again! Ive attached some photos tho not great as the room was a mess as we were leaving and it was 5am.WOULD RECCOMEND GOING OVER THE BORDER INTO ITALY - TARVISIO - IF SNOW IS POOR IN KRANJSKA GORA. Hotel can arrange Taxi, only 10 euro per person return based on 5 people.

Lovely hotel;4;5.03.2012;We stayed for one week at Hotel Lek and had a great time. The staff are extremely polite and obliging and the hotel very clean indeed. We had a superior twin room with balcony which was larger than expected and had more storage space than our own bedroom at home! Only issue in the bathroom is that the toilet is directly opposite the sink so care needs to be taken not to hit your head when a bit sleepy (or merry)! There is a large choice of buffet food every night which although not gourmet, is just what you need after a day's skiing. All in all, would happily recommend this hotel.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Excellent service and food;4;26.02.2012;We just came back from Kranjska Gora.We stay three nights at hotel Lek and we were very satisfied, from reservation process to check out. Location is good, close to the slopes.Service was fantastic and food is excellent.Welness centar offers everything you need. Free wifi at the lobby area and in the restaurant. Children mini club on 1st floor. Great value for money.

Ideal family friendly hotel;5;19.02.2012;Just arrived back from a weeks skiing holiday with my wife and 2 young boys.We were made so welcome and the hotel is as family friendly as they come.The location is quite yet a 5 minute walk and you are at the ski slopes.The food is buffet style and is great ,lots of choice of salad bar,soups ,meats ,fish and deserts .Additionally they had daily specials on the drinks menu which offered real good value.On valentines day all the tables were treated to a free bottle of bubbly and the daily attention to detail was excellent. The Hotel was impeccably clean and this was evident throughout.The staff were very helpful polite and friendly andmade you feel very welcome (Levels of service you rarely see) .We used the spa facilities everyday and they to were of a excellent standard.If I had to find any faults it would be petty, but wireless facility in the bedrooms would have been welcome and tea/coffee facilities in the rooms would have been welcome.Overall if your planning a skiing trip with your family then I could not recommend this hotel highly enough.Well done and thank you to all at Hotel LekMal,England;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
lovely hotel, fab location;5;14.02.2012;we have just arrived back from one weeks skiing, this hotel is great, very clean. we had a large balcony room and the children had the standard rooms, steer clear of the eves rooms as they are tiny ( my sister had one and moved straight away) way too small. food is good, not alot of choice alot of pork and potatoes, but more than enough even to fill two teenage boys. bar is nice was quiet while we where there, and although it looks scary from outside its a lovely warm cosy bar. rooms are very warm even in -20 outside had to have window open. bathrooms also spotless. we love slovenia having got married in bled and kranjska gora doesnt dissapoint, skiing is good would recommend the vopa bar for cheap drinks for apres ski. also try the warm wine available on the slopes.. amazing.. will be booking for 2013 asap.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Lovely Friendly Hotel;4;12.02.2012;"Just spent a week in a balcony room at the rear of the hotel which had a lovely view of the mountains and was spacious and clean, the beds however were not to our taste as they were twin beds which had a wooden surround around the mattresses so were very uncomfortable when you rolled onto them.The food in the restaurant was of good quality and plentiful with a good selection at breakfast and dinner, I am quite a fussy eater and I never struggled to find something to eat and there was a drinks offer on every evening with a choice of 3 different very drinkable wines for around 6 euros a bottle or beer/water/soft drinks starting at 0.99 cents.The hotel Manager runs a very tight ship and the staff were very efficient and polite and an empty plate never stayed on your table for more than 30 seconds before being swept away by one of the restaurants many staff.The swimming pool and jacuzzi was a strange set up as you had to use your room towel when using these facilities so were advised to get changed in our room and go to this area in a dressing gown which was supplied in our room which made the hotel reception look like a hospital at times.The hotel was very warm which was good as it was quite cold outside so be prepared to wear shorts in your room otherwise the temperature change once you leave can be shocking!The slopes are a 5 min walk away and the hotel supplies a perfectly good ski/boot room which I would recommend you using as it is free to do so, there are lockers on the slopes you can hire for 30 euros pr wk but they are about an equal distance from the Bernik Intersport ski school which Thompson/First choice/Crystal ski tend to use so you don't really gain anything but lose 30 euros!The only negative about the hotel was last day checkout was 11am and we were being picked up at 12:30 so asked if we could keep the room until 12 but this request was dismissed without any consideration which was rather annoying as the reception area was full of other people waiting to be collected at various times of the day so they was nowhere to sit and wait so we had to stand watching our empty room not being cleaned while we stood around, a small thing but irritating just the same.Kranjska Gora itself is a lovely quiet village so don't go here looking for wild nightlife as this is not the place, there are a few bars in the village which are worth a visit (Vopa was our favouite 2 euros a 1/2Litre of union beer) and the supermarket was good for a snack or drink if you wanted something less formal but the prices on the slopes were reasonable as well.This is a great place to go if you are virgin skiers like we were as the ski schools are very good and a private lesson could be bought for around 26 euros whci compared to the UK is very good value.So go enjoy Kranjska Gora and the Lek hotel you;ll love it.........we did and we're going back in 2013.";Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Great service, however not a 4 star;3;12.02.2012;Just returned from a 1 week skiing trip staying in the hotel Lek via First Choice. Hotel staff were all very friendly especially the regular bar man in the evening. From reading previous TA reviews we opted for a superior room to avoid the eaves issue! The room was quite spacious and had a balcony but was basic and not what you would call superior compared to other hotels we have stayed in. The food wasn’t great – average at best in fact. This was the case with both breakfast and dinner. We are not great fans of buffets for dinner which probably didn’t help but the food just seemed rather bland. I had pork one night and turkey the next and I couldn’t really tell the difference. Saying this, there was a good choice and we heard from fellow travellers that the food wasn’t good at the other hotels either. The bar was nice (although slightly hidden away downstairs) and had good music. The local wine is very good and great value although sometimes proved tricky to get dependant on who was serving you. We were told that ‘open wine’ (i.e. in a carafe) was not available on some occasions and ended up buying a bottle at a much higher price (to be fair the bottle of wine was very good). Good location – about 5 minute walk to the slopes and to the village centre. We had a couple of things break within the room (hairdryer and light) both were fixed very quickly after being reported.Would recommend a meal at Milka which is a 15 minute walk away where the food was the best we ate within the week. A bit of a trek in the snow and freezing temperatures although well worth it. In the summer I would suggest it as a ‘must do’ as it would be a lovely walk and location is overlooking the lake. Overall: very good service, average food and not a 4 star hotel by a long way.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Friendly Staff, Suitable for all;4;6.02.2012;Hotel Lek has a very good team of staff, always willing to take time to talk to you, teach you some Slovenian, or just help you out. The Hotel has many facilities such as spa, sauna, swimming pool(s), Fitness suite, lockers for skis, mountain bike storage and of course a bar..! The food was of a good standard and of reasonable variation, although breakfast was the same every day and not everyones 'cup of tea'!. The hotel is well placed and close to town, the lake, river, ski slopes and pretty much everything. The old town is also a couple of minutes walk away, which has a very pretty Austrian look to it. Quite a relaxed feel to the hotel and any problems, (eg. faulty lift), were fixed straight away. There is an additional daily charge for use of the Sauna/Jacuzzi, but Swimming Pool is free to guests, after a refundable deposit for an entry wrist band.Definately recommend this as a place to stay and relax, or as a base to explore the area.

Hotel Lek very helpful;5;5.02.2012;"We came skiing with Crystal here, 2 of our party were vegitarian. All four of us arrived late on the first night and the restaurant stayed open for us. Each evening they provided reduced price wines and beers, a wide range of vegitarian food and a generally wide range of foods across the board. We had paid a bit extra for a balcony room which were of excellent quality. The staff were very helpful, always checking we were ok in a positive but un-intrusive manner.The position is relatively close to the ski-slopes, the Crystal reps were reasonably bright but needed a bit of pushing to provide the correct answers to our questions, fortunatly Hotel Lek offer a PC in reception (and wifi) so we could check up on bus time tables etc. It is very easy to take a bus to llubianja and Lake Bled. Tourist info in the centre of town are helpful too. In addition the cross country ski area on the border with Italy is a 10 minute bus ride away and the team there are great fun with free tea and mulled white wine.Alpine learning to ski; then KG is not a bad place but take care as the behaviour of other users of the slope is not up to the best standards, one of our party were skiied into while on a button tow.Pool facilities could be hotter but perfectly acceptable, the gym facility looked but we never managed to fit it in :-)";Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Great holiday;5;4.02.2012;Just back from a week in this hotel, we were told we would have an eaves room and it was great, much larger than the eaves room we had last year in Austria where i hit my head repetedly, there was plenty of room here. We could have upgraded for another 80 pounds if we had wanted. The food quality and variety was excellent, staff could not have been nicer. The rooms were immaculate as were the swimming pools and facilities. hope to go back in the summer.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Wonderful time had!;4;1.02.2012;We've just got back from the Hotel Lek and a great skiing holiday despite the lack of snow!Having stayed in KG before we wanted to stay at another property to make it different, so after reading reviews we decided on the Lek as although it is about a five minute walk from the slops it is the only major hotel we could choose through our company that was not part of the HIT! chain.As previously mentioned in other reviews it is set at the edge of the village in the mountain valley, across from the river and close to a footpath taking you to the Jasna lakes.The hotel was traditional, very warm, with good facilities. It had a good pool and jacuzzi and a lovely sauna complex with a whirlpool, 3 saunas and a steam room.It was my birthday on the day of arrival and at our late dinner I was presented with a lovely bottle of wine and some jam - thank-you very much.The staff were absolutely brilliant, always there to help, always smiling. My husband had been in contact to arrange for a delivery to be taken and left for me for my birthday, which they did.As Veggies we're always apprehensive of what we'll eat. Each day there were various options for meals that we could eat as well as for meat eaters. Good selections of drinks and wines were also available. The desserts were excellent and one night we even had the famous Bled cake. We had our 'own' allocated table for the week which was also very nice.The rooms were as standard, we had one at the front with a balcony which gave lovely views.We had a wonderful weeks skiing and would not hesitate to return to the hotel if we went back to KG in winter or summer.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Magical Trip;5;15.01.2012;We've just got back from Slovenia, and are already missing the mountain landscape, beautiful room views, cold and fresh air, and cutest hotel in the world. There was not much of a natural snow, even if it was heavily snowing in neighbouring Austria, but just about enough for skiing as slopes were backed up by artifical one. We enrolled our 7 year girl into ski school, and she was properly skiing by the end of the day two! As for the hotel, it was fantastic. Set in the mountain valley, just by the tiny river that can be heard in the night when it gets quiet, it's close to village center and just around 5 mins to slopes. The hotel looks plesant, traditional, very warm, with good facilities. Our favourite one were pools, jacuzzi after the long day spent at slopes was just pure enjoyment and our little one enjoyed the medium one with whirpools. I'd like to mention that the staff was absolutely brilliant, always there to help, always smiling. As for the meals, you can't get wrong. There is pretty much everything on the table, from local to more european taste. The salad bar was really good, 5-6 varieties every day. Cakes and cooked meals were delicious, too. All in all, we had really pleasant stay and havae already made plans to go back next year!;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594

Pokey Inghams rooms;4;29.12.2011;Dont go with Inghams or you will get shoved into a pokey,dark attic room. It does tell you in the Inghams brochure that you will be up in the rafters but nothing can prepare you for just how bad it is. Ours was on the gable end with a sloping roof which cut out all of the light. This was a shame and we determined not to let it spoil our holiday as the hotel in every other respect was to our liking. Whilst some people have complained about the food we had no such worries and there was certainly plenty to choose from. The staff in the hotel were superb which is what you are looking for on holiday and were always cheerful and friendly.If you are an avid walker then there is plenty to go at although I would advise you take the Cicerone guidebook 'The Julian Alps of Slovenia' which features many of the walks in the area.If you are not too keen on high level or hard walks then there are plenty of easier walks about and the hotel is in the ideal location. Apart from the pokey room provided by Inghams a brilliant friendly place to visit which I would recommend. Shame on Inghams I say for putting their guests in inferior rooms, not good.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
A great place to stay in the Julian Alps;5;1.11.2011;This is a very nice hotel, in a spectacular mountain setting. The multilingual staff (as is usual in Europe) were very pleasant and helpful. We stayed for four nights. Because we booked at the last minute we had to change rooms once, and the staff re-arranged some other bookings so that we did not have to move an additional time. Our en-suite rooms were on the top floor (eaves rooms) which gave us fantastic views to the mountains. The buffet style meals were excellent, and varied every night. We would gladly return!;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Good Hotel, Good Service but beware the Eaves Rooms;4;5.09.2011;We stayed here as part of a package deal with a well known holiday company. The hotel is well located near to the village but opposite the river and a few minutes walk from the lake. There are good facilities with the Sauna, pool, fitness room and jacuzzi. The staff were very helpful and friendly and the food was of a good standard. However, what the Holiday company did not tell us that was that we had been given an Eaves room. This room is located in the roof space and has a sloping ceiling. It is very small and only has a velux window so no view and no balcony. On complaining the holiday company did not want to know so we were stuck with the room for the whole week. Luckily, the weather was good and there's plenty to do outside so it did not spoil our holiday and it is otherwise a good hotel and the staff were so helpful so I would otherwise recommend this hotel.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594

Food was of a very poor standard;3;13.08.2011;This is a lovely hotel set in a very scenic area.The bedroom and bathroom were of a very high standard.Staff were friendly and efficient.My only crticism is of the carvery dinner every evening.The food was always cold and on one occasion the fish on offer consisted of fish fingers.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Very good hotel and superb location for an active holiday;4;7.08.2011;"We visited the hotel in August on a Thomson Lakes and Mountains holiday, paying the extra for a room with a balcony and flying into Salzburg which meant a three and a half hour transfer through the stunning Alpine scenery and avoids the 03.00 a.m. departure on the final day.The hotel is large and the room we had was very good with an Austrian double bed with a divider, ample storage space, TV, balcony with mountain views and chairs for sunning oneself. The bathroom has only a powerful shower but is very large and clean. There isn't a kettle but there is a fridge, so if a cuppa is essential then I would recommend you bring a travel kettle and British tea bags. Decor wise there were some cracks on the walls and maybe the hotel could do with a touch up here and there, but it was very clean indeed and the staff were polite and attentive at all times.In the basement there is a delightful swimming pool, sauna and whirlpool, this was a godsend after a day's walking or mountain biking, and for those with more energy there was also a gym and treatment centre as well. The pool and gym were free to use with a €10 deposit for a fob key and were open from 07.00 - 21.00.The food was plentiful if not outstanding. Breakfasts consisted of a huge buffet choice; those wanting a full English perhaps need to look elsewhere, but there was bacon and scrambled eggs each day, along with a choice of cereals, cold meats and cheeses, several varieties of bread, yoghurts and fruit - enough to keep us going! As another report has stated the 'fruit juice' is just squash or watered down with the alternative being apple and beetroot juice mixed which was different. Some had packed lunches that were reported as being very 'bread' based and it seemed best to each locally. The evening meals were varied, with generous portions and very meat based. Starters included soup and local meat and vegetable starters, a fresh and varied salad choice followed by a choice of three or four mains, with the opportunity to have as many as one wished of each dish. these tended to be pork and chicken or turkey based but fish was available each day as well. The desserts were a varied selection of cakes, fresh fruit or very good ice cream - or all three! The only downside was mid week when the dessert seemed to be tinned fresh fruit salad. Twice a week there were themed nights with Slovenian dishes on one and Balkan on the other which were very good. Another useful point is the drinks deal which is available each night with specific wines, beers and soft drinks were available at a reduced price, the wine being about €4-6 and the beers €2 each, with the bottles being .50cl which is a decent amount.The hotel is very fine indeed and I would give it 4 stars for comfort with three for food.Other info - When we went the weather was very warm and settled and the whole area is certainly geared up to active pursuits. You have to enjoy walking or hiking along the excellent well marked trails though do invest in The Julian Alps of Slovenia by Justi Carey and Roy Clark as the maps are essentail but not quite Ordnance Survey. Excellent cross country biking along differnet levels of trails is available though bring padded shorts for this with hire between €7-10 per day on top mountain bikes and do use the reliable coach service to get around. The tourist information gives bus times but cross check at the bus station as some don't run all summer as we discovered, however, the buses are reliable and cheap more like coaches really. Lunches can easily be bought from the supermarket or the local bakery that serves a Slovenian snack of stuffed bread for €1.50. When out walking, the Doms or mountain inns are worth visiting and prices seemed the be fixed for most drinks and food. There is plenty to see and do but perhaps not the place for someone wanting culture and museums, but for someone wanting fresh air, mountains and lots of activities, it is first class.";Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Quite Disappointing;3;29.07.2011;This was a one night stopover on our way to Croatia. Plus points were that the room was large, with lots of storage space. Reception staff were helpful and our room was quiet and clean. Bad points were that the decor was very dated throughout the hotel, and it all looked a bit shabby. The Spa/pool area cost extra so we didn't bother. Breakfast was not up to the standard of a 4 star hotel, with nasty orange squash instead of real juice and a poor selection of food. At least it was included in the room rate as I would not have paid extra for such a meal. And at 110 euros the room rate was already too high for this standard of accommodation. I would not choose to go back.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Good quality for a Slovenian Hotel.;4;27.07.2011;"We're here in Summer, as an alternative to a beach holiday as we understood that there was a lot of outdoor activity, and there is. Day 3 & we've walked lake Bled, cycled to Italy, and had a day at the Luge, so there are many things to do in Kranjska Gora, and we haven't even done a mountain walk yet. So the hotel; well Lek is rated as a 4 star, yet in English standards it would probably be a 3 star. For half board, the food is all buffet, and its mass produced, and over cooked, but what else would you get with a hot buffet. If you have kids it works well, as there is a good selection of food, and treats, and they care for kids. If you're here for the food then you've picked the wrong Country; try Italy perhaps, but if you're here to explore something different at reasonable value, with great surroundings, then I'd recommend it, & I've had a really enjoyable time so far. If you're a teacher looking for a group holiday - then it's your dream come true!";Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Not really 4*;3;9.07.2011;Very mediocre, Staff were variable - silly rules in restaurant about not taking in open bottles, no corking bottles for the next day, even water!Skylight window in room, so no view. Bathroom smelled of sewerage several times. It was sorted when reported, but built up again overnight. If not reported, it became really unpleasant and the whole room smelled. Restaurant food was unimaginative and global -same or similar selection from serve- yourself every evening.Packed lunches were provided if booked night before but were very expensive (5 or 8 €). Supermarket nearby sells filled buns.Good thing to do is to hire bikes from shop next to Tourist information. It is only 7 km to Italian border along a flat bike path. We paid 7€ for a day's bike hire. Nice town over border which had a leather market.Avoid the fruit seller in the town unless you want to be told-off for buying only one item of fruit, having less than 250g cherries, more than 1 thin plastic bag, or touching fruit before buying. You will get banned if you infringe any of his rules. Pros- area, scenery, strenuous walkingCons - Not many chair lifts etc. If you want to get to a mountain top -you have to walk all the way up, and all the way down.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Excellent early summer holiday;4;6.06.2011;Kranskja Gora is a great place to stay at the end of May/early June. Their summer season hasn't started yet and so it is very quiet, but the weather is good and you can enjoy the walking and cycling without the crowds. Hotel Lek is in a quiet location, on the village edge but only a few minutes walk to the center where you can hire bikes for just 7euros for 6 hours. There are two good flat cycle routes, one to Italy and the other in the opposite direction to some scenic waterfalls. Both trips are c. 40km. Our room a the Lek was a good size. We paid for a superior room with balcony on the ground floor, which was useful on the one rainy day because we could lunch on the balcony and still admire the good views. The pool area is great for children, swimming pool plus separate whirlpool area kept them busy each evening. The restaurant is a good size so you don't feel crushed in and the views from there are good too. Breakfast is decent enough although the same every day, cereals, yoghurt, very good selection of breads, hot dog sausage, bacon, scrambled and boiled eggs. The packed lunches weren't great, a dry roll without filling, chocloate croissant, apple and apple juice - again the same every day. The evening meal starters were a good selection of salads/ bread/ cold meat. The main course revolved around meat and potato. The meat was good, the potato and vegetables generally not. We did have a very good pasta one night. Desert again the same every night - cakes and ice-cream. Wine is very reasonably priced c. 7 euros a bottle. The afternoon tea provided was poor. It was served in a basement room, dark and out of the way. The pastries advertised in the Inghams brochure didn't make an appearance, we had dry biscuits every day. On the last two days there was a conference and so tea was served in the bar, this was much better, a comfortable area, light and a pleasant place to enjoy tea. Prices in the hotel bar for drinks are expensive for this area, it is much cheaper to have beer, coffee or ice-cream in the local bars which are only a few minutes walk away. Hotel staff are great, very helpful throughout.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Loved it!;5;13.03.2011;"Have just returned from a week here. We travelled with a variety of ages, 12 of us in total, from parents, 20 yr olds, 14yr olds, 11yrs and 7yrs. We had a lovely time! Hotel is spotless, staff extremely polite, fun and helpful. Food was great, there's plenty of choice there for everyone... Don't listen to the negatives on here, I don't understand why some people complain, maybe they are just some of life's moaners, believe me, I have travelled and stayed in some fantastic hotels and this one was brill. Short walk to the slopes, but as said on here previously, hire a locker, then you don't have carry your equipment back with you. We did have some glorious sunny days, which did make the snow slushy by the end of the day, but it is coming to the end of the season here. Your lift pass does include night skiing too, so thats a bonus! Supermarket sells ready made sarnies, or the small bars do hotdogs, chips etc . Have a look in the village church, its beautiful. My husband and two older kids are brilliant skiers/boarders and did say they found the runs boring and not very challenging, but as I tend to remind them our March holiday is our \family\"" ski holiday, their January \""boys\"" holiday is for their black run experiences! Lovely swimming pool, jacuzzi and smaller pool which is free, as to is the internet in the reception. All in all for the price we paid for the holiday we felt it was complete value for money""";Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Third visit!;5;27.02.2011;Just returned from our third consecutive visit to this lovely Hotel. Again it was great, the service and staff were excellent and any request was met quickly and efficiently. The cleanliness is superb and our rooms were spotless and thoroughly cleaned each day. The views from the superior rooms on are beautiful and are well worth going for. It is really well located for the slopes if you are skiing and is only a 5 minute (max) walk with skis etc. Restaurant service is very good, the food is fine and plentiful managing to satisfy a fussy teenage boy!All in all a lovely stay.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Slovenia Ski Holiday;4;31.01.2011;We stayed at Lek whilst on a 1 week Ski holiday in Kranska Gora. We booked through Iglu / Crystal which were both very helpful. We found the trip to Slovenia to be much better value than neighbouring Italian and Austrian resorts, the resort is just 7km from the Austrian border.The hotel was great for the price. We stayed half board, the food was relatively good and there was lots of variety - bring your own tea bags if you're a tea addict like me, Slovenian tea was a little odd! The room was great - spacious and spotless. We paid a little extra when booking for a large twin. There was free WiFi in the lobby and the swimming pool / hot tub was spotlessly clean and free to use. The location of the hotel was a short 5 - 10 min. walk to the chair lifts. We rented a locker at the Eurosport Rental place right beside the lifts which was great, no trapsing about in ski boots or carrying equipment. The hotel bar was expensive but I suppose they always are. There are always drinks offers at dinner if you stay half board and the local lager 'Union' is 80c from the local supermarket (5 mins away)! Staff were very friendly. We had no problems at the accomodation at all, would highly reccommend. The other crystal hotel 'Hotel Larix' also looked fantastic and was right next to the slopes.The resort of Kranska Gora itself was also a pleasant suprise. We didnt travel with children but we did notice that the Slovenians seemed very geared towards little ones, and made a big fuss over them at the hotel, in the resort and on the slopes which was lovely. It hadn't snowed for a couple of weeks when we were there but the maintainence of the slopes was good and conditions more than adequate, there were snow cannons everywhere. The resort had about 3 chair lifts, 8 button lifts and was linked to the smaller resort of Podkoren by another chair lift. Our only complaint of the resort was that the runs were a little limited and although there were 2 good blue runs at the bottom of the resort most of the other runs were red / black. On our first day our planned red run was closed and we had to go down the World Cup black run to get back down! Great for us, as we're confident skiers but not so great if you're less experienced, there was no warning at the bottom of the lift of run closures so could take some people by suprise! The resort was fairly quiet at night but there was a bar called Vopa that has a nightclub downstairs which seemed popular and busy everynight with sport, quizzes, live bands etc.Overall, I'd reccommend this hotel and resort. I dont think we will return as the resort just isnt big enough for us, other than this we had a great time and found it to be good value for money.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Great time;4;16.01.2011;Standard room very clean and functional. bathrobe supplied by hotel for use in the swimming area.Dining area large & spotless clean, staff very helpful and pleasant..this was my first time in Slovenia but hopefully not my last Bar prices slightly higher than the local pub's but not to extreme.Good food, typical breakfast, various cereals. eggs and bacon, fruit.Evening dinner choice of 2 soups, 3 main courses, salads, and various sweets/ ice cream's;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Lek and Load;5;31.10.2010;We first stayed at the Lek 20 years ago and went back for our 20th anniversary since discovering Slovenia.Ok we‘re biased because we love the place but this was an exceptional holiday. It was hot and yes walking was more difficult but not imposible. It was only up to 34 degrees at its worst. The restaurant staff were great. However, I would agree with anyone who says they have a particular way of doing things in the restaurant which even with our experience took a bit of getting used to. I certainly agree with the clear everything away early comment as we nearly got caught out on first night. I also agree with the absurdity of the Health and Safety regulations –lets be honest its not about H and S -its about running a tight ship of a restaurant – nothing more , nothing less . Against this was one of the most exceptionally generous acts I have ever seen in a hotel. My wife celebrated her 65th birthday whilst we were there and on her birthday the hotel gave us a la carte food, an imaginatively decorated table, free brandy, a floral display, sparkling wine, two beautiful gifts and most of all an outpouring of warmth and care that is simply typical of the beautiful country in the world.I also have to say we experienced the wedding – admittedly not below us. We didn’t hear anything and if we had we would have remembered what its like to get married….Sorry but the hell do you expect on a wedding day? We congratulated the couple by the way….The hotel out of the centre of the village so f course it’s a bit quieter and I do wish there was a bit of a communal area. We simply stayed out a bit longer in the village. The hotel comes into its own as a walking base – stroll up to Jasna and then straight into the national park. It s less of an advantage of you want to head towards Italy though the cycle track to the border is usually populated by loud American MAMILs on bikes. Far better to go the other way to the waterfalls. It’s a prettier walk anyway Hotel rooms were superb in every respect – absolutely faultless in all aspects Reception staff was not defensive at all - they were lovely the whole two weeks and very supportive and friendly. We had a problem getting into the pool area (the door jammed) and the staff were great in sorting the problem in two minutes. The restaurant staff act very much as a team – the hotel closes for three – four days in the late autumn and the staff go away as a team paid for by the hotel using their collective tips pool for spending money – this year they go to Prague – have a lovely time folks.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Brilliant Location & lovely Hotel;5;28.09.2010;A bit dubious before arriving due to previous reviews, however my partner and I were very happy with Hotel Lek.Paid for a superior room which basically includes a balcony but after being allocated a room at the back of the hotel we asked reception if there was availabilty at the front with views etc and this was sorted for us in a few minutes by a very helpful man. Rooms were spacious and bathroom decorated to a high spec we felt.Food was delicious. I am a fussy eater but found plenty to eat at breakfast and dinner. Restaurant staff were very efficiant and friendly, including the manager and we enjoyed all our meals. The salad at dinner was fab, as was the soup and main selection.Free use of internet wasa bonus and pool and whirlpool were good for those rainy days.We hired a car for one day so that we could drive across to both Italy and Austria. Our rep quoted us L60 for one day, however we went online at the hotel and found the website Economy Cars' where we purchased car hire for 30 Euro only, including insurance with no access. The car was booked 2 days in advance and was dropped and picked-up from our hotel which was brilliant. It may be worth doing this rather than taking the buses which were quite expensive eg L12 each to Bled and back or L18 each to the capital. Those buses take forever as well!Scenery was fantastic especially from Hotel Lek. Little town was lovely and the best location we came across in Slovenia. Food was very reasonable. There was a really good pizza restaurant and a nice Slovenian restaurant that we found where we were getting a massive lunch for under 15 Euro inc drinks for the two of us. This compares to a tiny lunch with ine drink between us in Taviso Italy where we were robbed of 16 Euro for the a bit of lettuce, a plate of pasta and a soup. Austria which was much better value.At night we went to the nearest Casino on the main road and actually left L70 up after a few visits so we cant complain. Soft drinks were also free while you gambled and they do have bingo as well. We booked with Ingrams and would do again, as our transfers were very organised and the rep was full of knowledge.For you fisherman out there, be warned that a day permit around the town is 20 Euro with a lack of fish. Lake Bled has plently of fish including carp, however the permit is 50 Euro a day!! They mostly fly fish in the rivers. Lake Bled by the way, ok but very over priced. Horse & cart rides were advertised as 30 Euro and 12 Euros for the boat trips. We opted for the little train around the lake which was 3 Euros each.Overall we were glad that we chose Hotel Lek as we believe it is the best hotel there and would definately recommend Kranjska Gora as a lovely and quite get away in September.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Comfortable but with some shortcomings;3;19.09.2010;We stayed for one week in early Sept as a part of of multi centre holiday with Inghams. The hotel is beautifully located, facing the mountains, on the edge of the village but only five minutes walk to the village centre. There is a comfortable reception / lounge area and staff were friendly and helpful. Free internet access in the reception area.We had a 'superior' room (room 17) on the first floor, with window and small balcony overlooking the tennis court and beyond to the mountains. The bedroom was moderately spacious with a comfortable bed, a settee, small table, lots of storage space, minibar and tv. The modern bathroom was tiny and cramped with corner shower unit (no bath) that leaked into the main area because the doors didn't shut properly. About 1ft of space to stand in between washbasin and toilet.The restaurant for breakfast and dinner was large and fortunately we were allocated a nicely located table (for superior room residents?) but there were a few dreadful tables nearby, which we would have hated. The buffet breakfast was OK with a wide range of hot and cold food. Coffee (from a machine) was good but orange juice (also from a machine) was abysmal, for which there is no excuse. The evening dinner was buffet style served from 7.00pm. Salad bar was fine but soups and main courses were generally lukewarm even early on in the evening. Choice of meat or (unidentified) fish for main course and potatoes/ vegetables was OK and plentiful but it was all a bit works canteen/ school dinner like and overall quality was definetly not what I would rate as four star. Desserts were usually small pieces of local cake or ice cream - I usually had both to make up a decent sized portion. (I don't think we were intended to do this, as the ice cream and dessert cake were at opposite ends of the dining room!). Our package included a free drink with dinner, which was nice. But special offer wines and beers in the restaurant were also relatively inexpensive (much cheaper than in Austrian hotels).The hotel also offered an inside swimming pool and whirlpool, which we did not use but other guests told us were great. In good weather Kranjska Gora is a spectacular mountain resort with access to great walks and excursions into Slovenia (latter a bit expensive). Lake Bled is also easily accessible by local bus. In summary, we had a pleasant stay but Hotel Lek (and Slovenia) is struggling to match the high standards of its western European neighbours.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594

Thoroughly enjoyable holiday apart from the weather;4;12.09.2010;I was very surprised to hear of other visitors apparent problems with the staff at this hotel but I suppose it takes all sorts.For us the situation was superb .. .. on the edge of the village only 5 minutes walk from the centre but with stunning views up the valley to the magnificent high white-coloured limestone mountain peaks. Opposite the pale turquoise river and man-made waterfall could be heard. We had paid the extra for a superior room with balcony which we felt was worth it for that view.We had no problems whatsoever with the restaurant seating arrangements and can see the advantages to the management as once guests had finished their meals and left the room the very efficient staff were able to set their table for the next meal. We sat with a lovely friendly couple but would have been quite happy sitting with most guests present during our week there. Being on a 'half-board' package we only expected a limited choice of dishes and were nearly always satisfied with our choices (helped occasionally by advice from our neighbours).The rooms were very clean as were the common parts. We found all the staff to be friendly and helpful.Sadly for us we were unlucky with the weather for the 1st 4 days of our week (same all over central Europe though) and we couldn't see the mountains for that time. The scenery around Kranska Gora really is something special and many keen walkers are attracted to the well-marked trails there. Shopping options are limited as are places to buy lunchtime light snacks. We were happy to eat in every evening so didn't really test the village restaurants.We would certainly go back to the resort and having looked at other hotels there and spoken with guests we would also choose the Hotel Lek again next time.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Lovely location, dismal restaurant;1;25.08.2010;Stayed in the Lek for a ten day walking holiday in July. Hit a heatwave so walking was curtailed. Hotel is located on the outskirts of the town and is very quiet with wonderful views. Room very spacious with a pleasant private balcony. Bathroom adequate and clean. Pleasant indoor swimming pool just about large enough for a proper swim. Patio area with about a dozen sun loungers (not enough). Younger staff generally helpful. Seem to have a lot of regular guests and popular with Italians. Restaurant overall very disappointing. Breakfast was fine with a good choice. The evening meal was standard canteen fare and it felt like a canteen with the main course served onto your plate from a hot tray. Result was I got more than I wanted and it was pretty bland. One issue really annoyed us. In the evening you are given a sheet with the drinks offers for that night which includes wine (incidentally the wine list has nothing under 20 euros a bottle) and on the bottom of the sheet it says as a result of HACCP (google it!) the restaurant is unable to store opened bottles of wine and you cannot bring wine into the restaurant. What a joke, keeping an open bottle of wine to drink the next night has never been an issue in any hotel we have stayed at in the last thirty years. After that we had absolutely no qualms about buying wine from the supermarket and enjoying it on our balcony. There are plenty of genuine hazards in this hotel without inventing them. Food is cleared away well before the advertised closing time, so don’t be late for meals. A couple of incidents are worth recording. A door leads off the restaurant onto a pleasant outside terrace with half a dozen tables. Why these are not laid for breakfast during fine weather is beyond me as they would be very popular. We noticed that the guests took a cup of coffee outside after breakfast and on the second day we followed suit. The following we were the last in the restaurant and set off for the terrace with a glass of fruit juice when one of the waitresses said we weren’t allowed to take it outside. I pointed out we had been outside on the previous day and at this point her supervisor intervened. We repeated what we had said to the waitress and at this he completely lost the plot. He started shouting at us saying he was the restaurant manager and he decided what is and isn’t allowed. It was outrageous behaviour and when it looked as though I was going to ignore him he had the nerve to say that we would be charged (ie bar prices) if we took the juice outside. It was thirty seconds of Fawlty Towers. I should have ignored him or thrown the juice at him, he certainly deserved it. In the UK I would have packed up and been away in an hour. We noticed the Brits were always stopped from going outside but the Italians always seemed to slip out. When we arrived we noticed a note at reception saying there was to be a private party on the Saturday and guests were asked for their understanding. Fair enough. However the party turned out to be a wedding and we were immediately above the venue in the basement and when the music started at 21.00 it was clear that we were in for a long night. The volume was totally unreasonable. At 23.45 I went to ask at reception when it was likely to finish but the receptionist was very defensive. She said it was an important day for the couple etc etc (the music was extra loud in reception) and did not know when the music would finish. I said the guests at the hotel had paid a lot hoping for a quiet holiday and she said that the rates at the Lek were in fact low, and the hotel depended on the extra income. She kept repeating this low room rate comment and was totally unsympathetic. The amplified music finished at 02.00 to be replaced by community singing to an accordion. I finally got to sleep at 03.30. Guests we spoke to at the front of the hotel were less bothered by the music than by the rowdy smokers who had nipped outside. The hotel is owned by an international pharmaceutical company called Sandoz (not sure why they are in the hotel business but it explains the HACCP nonsense above) but there is something not quite right with the concept of service, particularly in the restaurant. One star awarded (just). Just behind the Lek is the privately owned Hotel Miklic which gets good reviews here and was serving food well past 21.00 when we visited.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594

Beautiful location - shame about the maitre'd!;1;16.08.2010;"If you like summer hiking in the mountains and you don't require breakfast or dining facilities (unless you are an Italian) then this is the place for you. The Lek is beautifully situated on the edge of the town nearest the Triglav National Park and whilst the decor was dated, the hotel facilities were perfectly adequate.However, the dining arrangements appeared to be a relic of the old communist regime. You will sit where you are told to, with whoever the maitre'd decides, even if (as was the case on most days) the restaurant was half empty. He reserved 'treats', such as ice-cream, until an Italian coach-trip arrived. Residents were then advised that they could help themselves once the Italians had left!Querying these 'arrangements' resulted in the maitre'd screaming at you across the half-empty dining room as you squeezed into your chair backing onto the only other diners. This restaurant is great news if you want basic food served with a main order of public humiliation.Complaints to the reps were not worthwhile as this man already had a notorious reputation. Due to his awful behaviour we ate out every day (after passing his scowling face at the reception desk) even though we had paid for half-board. On the plus side, at least this meant we had decent food for the second week.

Chocolate box experience;5;24.03.2010;We ( myself and my two teenage boys) stayed at the Hotel Lek in Kransjka Gora on our first skiing holiday and we loved it. Our hotel room was roomy and our beds were very comfortable. We had a balcony which was great especially for the boys snow boards.The hotel was always kept at a really nice temperature which we appreciated every time we came back from the piste.Some review have mentioned the rooms and some people have had great experiences and some not so great. But what really makes the hotel one that I would gladly return to is the staff. They were absolutely brilliant, I am so grateful to them as they were always happy, attentive and always happy to help. One of my sons was ill during our holiday and they supplied him with endless cups of mint tea and dry crackers.We really liked the food and we ate lots of it as we were so hungry in the evenings. The hotel is quiet and you need to go into town if you are looking for nightlife - but everything is so close it hardly matters.All in all I would thoroughly recommend this hotel.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Pleasantly surprised;4;1.03.2010;Hotel Lek, Kranjska Gora, Slovenia.We booked a last minute ski trip to Kranjska Gora after checking that they had some snow. We chose the Hotel Lek as it was close to the slopes (but so are most of the hotels in this small town) and it had a pool and hot tub.After reading some reviews on Tripadvisor we paid the extra for a room with balcony and were pleasantly surprised by the size of our room. It was probably a family room as it also had a sofa bed in the main area and had plenty of storage space. The bathroom was fairly large, all tiled and only had a shower which wasn’t a problem as we used the whirlpool to unwind after skiing. The only complaint we had was with the bed which had a wooden frame up the middle and the mattresses were not very comfortable. Tables in the dining room were allocated for the entire stay. Breakfast was the usual buffet of fruit, cereals, cold meats, cheese and a small cooked selection. Dinners were buffet style with the main course served by staff. Starters of soup / salad were tasty but I found the main courses a bit repetitive by the end of the week and none of them were exceptional. Sweets were small cake type offerings accompanied by a fantastic ice cream selection which always went down well especially with children.Special offers on drinks were available every night at dinner and we had some half decent local wines at reasonable prices. On the whole drinks were not as dear as some of the other rip off European countries and were even cheaper out-with the hotel.The staff were very helpful and attentive sometimes overly so in the dining room where you sometimes got the impression they were standing by to whip your plate away before you had finished your mouthful of food, but they were very efficient. Special mention must go to Adela Porec who always took time to chat and made our stay very enjoyable.The hotel had a small gym, a sauna and pool area with hot tub, spa pool, decent sized main pool and children’s pool. A micro chip band was required to gain entry with a 10 euro deposit. Ski lockers were also available again for a 5 euro deposit although it was a bit of a struggle to fit 2 pairs of modern skis inside them.The downstairs cafe-bar served lunch and snacks and had an outdoor seating area which caught the sun in the afternoon with great views across to the mountains.All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and were pleasantly surprised by the hotel. If the ski area was bigger and snow conditions were more consistent we would have no hesitation in going back to Kranjska Gora and staying at the Lek.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Repeat visit!;5;20.02.2010;"Following a lovely stay at the Lek last year we didn't hesitate to go back again this year. It really is a great hotel, excellent value for money and the staff are all very good - nothing is ever too much trouble. Personally we felt it had improved in terms of the food this year, they really seem to be trying on that front; seeing my plain eating teenage son demolish plate after plate of food each night without complaint was a pleasure to see!We stayed in one of the balcony rooms and I would thoroughly recommend going for one of these if you can - they are spacious, well located and have incredible views.The Pool etc was great, always clean and rarely busy and after a hard day of Skiing was very welcome.....Shop around for deals on the Lek if you're going Skiing, we went with Balkan holidays this year and they were really competitive pricewise - the Rep service was also good; we went with Inghams last year who were also good.Walk to the Pistes takes only 5 minutes - there is a Ski room with Lockers in the base of the Hotel which leads out to the back of the Hotel, always ask other Skiers to show you the shortcut to the slopes and don't be bother paying the 30 euros a week to rent a locker which will only end up being about a minute closer!!";Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Great find;4;18.02.2010;As has been said Hotel Lek is set in a nice quiet location and is an easy 5 minute walk to the centre of the village. Graded 4 star and could be classed as a modern conference hotel but not in the Tyrolean style you get over the border. However, it was well run and very clean. Staff in the hotel were lovely – pleasant and always had time to talk to you. We had booked a ‘small eaves double room’ and expected it to be smaller-than-small, but we were pleasantly surprised at how much storage space there was. Yes, the double bed was up against one wall but a boxed radiator shelf ran the length of it and made a handy bedside table! Our luggage packed neatly under the table (yes there was room for a table and chair) and there was plenty of storage space. Room extremely warm as with all ski-resort hotels but by 2nd night we’d open the window (!) and it was a lovely night’s sleep. (Can see how it would be stuffy in the summer.) The bathroom was tiny but extremely clean with a great big towel radiator. Shower was powerful and hot. We had clean towels every day and I liked having the boxed tissue dispenser instead of loo rolls. Both breakfast and evening meals had plenty of variety. Lovely salad bar and a self-service ice cream counter – heaven! The Lek had special deals on drinks every night - usually a bottle of white/bottle of red/a beer/soft drink. Great prices (approx €6.50 per bottle wine/beer €2). Some great Slovenian wines! The cheapest tab we’ve ever had for 7 nights! The bar had different prices! Used the pool twice, early in the morning – pool temperature lovely and had place to ourselves. Free ski lockers in the hotel but for €10 a week we used the lockers at the Hotel Larix which was right in front of the ski school lessons area - just go to the reception desk and ask.The skiing in Kranjska Gore is ideal for beginners and early intermediates with the good ski school providing lessons in a 2 hour slot beginning at 11am. For higher level skiers the resort does not hold much of a challenge and can be skied in a few days. Booked this resort because one of us does a little cross-country. However due to lack of interest there was no ski-school during our stay (1st week in Feb) only private lessons. Booked one-hour through Intersport Bernik - tutor was great.Having said that if you’re a good skier travelling with a mixed ability group then you can just add a day’s skiing further afield to say Nassfeld (check out http://www.nassfeld.at/en/) or Obertauern in Austria which is about 1hour or so away. I booked during with the week with Jay at “Enka Lounge Bar” which you can find on the left hand side as you walk into the village from the hotel. Jay (English) and his partner (Slovenian) have been running the business for a number of years and you can find details on http://simply-slovenia.com/. The day trip cost for Nassfeld was €75 but when you consider that a day lift pass was €39 then it’s not bad value for money for driving you there and guiding you in the resort so no need to check the piste map! We also went on a snow-shoeing guided walk with him – awesome views and a good 3hour walk with a well-earned tea-stop with schnapps half way! Kranjska Gore does not have a great night life but check out Enka bar & bar “Vopa” almost opposite Hotel Larix being the busiest and both serving a large beer at €2. We ate out twice in the afternoons – huge pizzas at Hotel Kotnik just past the church (€6.50 each – one more than enough for 2). Also had traditional food at the Pri Martinu which was excellent.Loads of different trips are offered by the travel companies & the local tourist office & companies can also help out.

Nice and adequate;3;7.02.2010;"My partner and i decided that we wanted to go for a skiing holiday and after extensive research we came across Hotel Lek which met all of our requirements-pool, bar etc. We eventually managed to book via lastminute.com and saved 50%-L279 per person (half board) instead of L599-we were impressed. We arrived on the Saturday and then had a long 3.5 hours minibus drive to the resort of Kanjska Gora. Upon arrrival at the hotel we were greeted and then had an opportunity to look around at the facilities and study the welcome pack which we had received via Inghams-our tour operator. We tried, without much success to meet up with our Inghams rep -the map that was provided was not the best as it was upside down and around the wrong way! The village itself was nice, a few bars, a casino (if you can call it that!) and some other nice hotels-Prisank and LarixOur room was a basic double with a small shower room/WC. It had a slanted roof and a nice view of the snow capped peaks which surrounded us. We had a TV with many channels, a hairdryer but to our dismay had no tea making facilities. The general cleanliness of the hotel was good and the staff were also very friendly-i must mention a nice guy called Anel who was great. The swimming pool was adequate. The pool itself was small and the water was very cold. The \jacuzzi\"" was luke warm and the various jets around this area were only activated at mid day which we found very strange! The temperature needed to be a lot hotter and in addition the sauna was actually charged as an extra on a daily basis so was not included in the package which was disappointing. We also had to pay a deposit of 10 euros to use the pool. The reaturant was a decent size and the meals were of a good quality with a nice selection for breakfast. The evening meal was good and there were daily drinks specials at a reasonable rate. The bar was not that great. It was in a small basement like room with no views-the windows were like port holes which made you feel slightly claustrophobic. The drink selection was good and was not overly expensive, nuts and crisps were also provided FOC with drinks. We met four new friends whilst at the resort-Becca, Beccas Dad, Adam and Zaynab and during our stay it was one of their birthday's (Ad) The hotel staff were fantastic. When we arrived at our evening meal (we always sat at a six seater table by the window in the restaurant) we were greeted by the hotel manager who showed us to our table which had been \""dressed up\"" to a very high standard. We were then given two bottles of their premier red wine which equated to 50 euros. A chocolate birthday cake was also supplied and the staff had made a card and also gave two bottles of liquer for the birthday boy-we were treated as if we were celeb's! The staff had gone out of their way to make the moment special and it was greatly appreciated! The resort as a whole was good but is definitely marketed more at beginner level skiiers because the runs were limited. In addition we were VERY disappointed by a couple of the lift operators. As a novice boarder i was slightly dubious about using the t-bar and drag lifts. On my first day i tried to use the drag lift without much success-i fell off a couple of times and the lift operator was very rude, unhelpful which greatly knocked my confidence. We complained to our rep, however did not receive any feedback, therefore we will be contacting Inghams direct as his behaviour was not acceptable particularly when you consider how expensive the lift passes are-145 euros! I would only recommend this resort if you can get a latstminute deal. i certainly would not have wanted to pay anymore than what we did. However saying that, the hotel was adequate and the skiing was good. The bonus for us was meeting four new friends, had we not met them then i think that the holiday would have not been so good :)""";Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Great food and hospitality at the Lek;4;30.12.2009;I have just returned from a Christmas break at the Lek. Overall the stay was great with oustanding staff that all go the extra mile to make you feel welcome and at home from the moment you arrive. You can tell all the staff enjoy working here and are professional in what they do.We stayed on half board at the hotel and thought that the food in the restaurant was of good quality- tasty and plentiful and a good representation of Slovenian cuisine in general. Again all the staff in the restaurant are genuinely pleasant and have great attention to detail.Extra touches such as mulled wine and a choir in the foyer on Christmas eve really made the holiday special.The facillities at the hotel are also excellent, with a modern and well-designed leisure/pool complex, which is large and inviting. Architecturally, the hotel is a mixed bag- it isn't really traditional inside but it can appear a tad dated in places.. The leisure facillities, glass elevator and basement bar seem more contemporary however.If you are looking for a cutting edge 'design/boutique' atmosphere, the hotel probably isn't for you. Having said that the hotel feels cosy and in keeping with its mountain surroundings. There are also quite a variety of different room types on offer- we booked attic doubles/twins- and these can seemingly vary in quality slightly and are without doubt quite small (as previous reviewers have commented). We booked 3 rooms in our party and found one of the rooms to be slightly better than the other 2. Those on floor 2 have lower windows with a better view, however I did not like the layout of those rooms on floor 1 as much. It has to be noted however that we felt that the rooms were reasonable value over the (Christmas) period which we visited in this popular resort. Some Attic doubles have a bed against the wall, but this didn't prove an issue for us- if it is a problem, it is worth paying the extra for a standard/superior room.The hotel's location in Kranjska Gora is good- a short walk to the village and ski slopes, but far enough away so that the position feels more secluded. Overall I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to experience outstanding Slovenian hospitality in beautiful mountain surroundings.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
nice but!!!!!!;3;5.11.2009;"MY wife and I travelled to kranjska on a package with Inghams and having read the reviews about the lek on \tripadvisor\"" I had high expectations, on arrival my first impression was how inviting the hotel looked from outside however the elusion was soon shattered, when I entered the reception area the first thing that struck me was how uninviting and dated it looked. when we reached our room things didnt get any better, I knew it was going to be small but this was crazy, there was only room to get down one side of the bed so the person nearest to the wall had to slide down the length of the bed to go to the loo in the night, the only window in the room was tiny and so high up that my wife had to stand on the bed to see out, not that there was anything to see and there was a curtain tied back with a bit of string not to mention the wire hanging out of the plaster, not what you expect in an hotel that has an official 4 star rating. The hotel did have a fantastic pool complex and the restaurant was very pleasent with nice furnishings, the food was adequate and plentifull (avoid the slovenian specialities, yuck!). what was missing was a decent lounge area in the hotel as we read in the evenings and it would have been nice to escape the poky room. Kranjaska itself was very pretty and ther are great walking and biking oportunities. in conclusion a nice hotel if you can afford a larger room but not worthy of its 4 stars.""";Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594

A hotel with high standards in a stunning location;5;25.09.2009;We have just returned from a 2 week holiday staying at Hotel Lek. I have genuinely no criticisms of the hotel at all and we loved every minute of our stay there. The staff particularly in the restaurant were excellent. The selection of food at the buffet breakfast and buffet dinner was plentiful and varied. Our room and all the facilities at the hotel were immaculate. Taking pride in the hotel was evident from the staff sweeping the car park every morning and by opening the breakfast bar for us at 4am for coffee on our final day. We appreciated the fact we were given a packed breakfast on our departure. I was sad to leave and will go back one day.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Good value hotel in Kranjska Gora;4;24.09.2009;We decided to go to Slovenia as a cheaper option to Austria where we had been 2 years running and we were very pleased with our choice of both hotel and resort. The Lek offers good value for money, it is a pleasant hotel with good facilities and we made full use of the pool area and fitness room (Beware of the sign above the entrance to the pool which says 'Don't be pig' to those not showering beforehand!. The food was plentiful and varied, we were quite bemused by the daily special offers on the drinks which started at 5 euros for a bottle of wine and increased by 50 cents each night thereafter! There is not a lot going on in town at night but we enjoyed a drink at the Loom Bar which plays a good CD of 80s music. Kranjska Gora is an excellent destinatioin for walking and a great place to cycle as there are many dedicated cycling paths.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Not for the more discerning traveller;3;16.09.2009;We stayed at the Hotel Lek for 3 nights as part of an organised tour by Inghams of Slovenia and Croatia and so had no choice of hotel or room category. The hotel is very pleasant with a nice terrace where drinks (at very good prices) are served. The public rooms in the hotel are quite nice and there is a pleasant bar area on the lower ground floor. We found the staff and service to be very good and probably the best of all the hotels where we stayed in Slovenia and Croatia.Our room was a big disappointment being a very small loft room. There was a good amount of storage space and the shower-room was fine. The bedroom area was very tight and we had to stand on the bed to open the window which was a small triangular affair. The worst part of the room was the double bed which had one side against the wall – not very practical. The breakfast is served buffet style and the choice is acceptable but not as good as you might get in a 4 star hotel in Austria or Switzerland. Dinner is also served buffet style and the quality of the food was no more than OK. If you don’t mind queuing for your dinner canteen style and it’s simply a case of getting something to eat then you may be OK. Personally I would recommend the excellent Italian restaurant in the village which served very good food at reasonable prices and a litre of wine for less then 9 Euros.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Excellent value for money;5;28.07.2009;A very traditional, accessible and welcoming hotel. Our room was very comfortable, clean and spacious. The staff were very friendly and the hotel offered that little more in terms of something traditional and local. The views from the restaurant were most pleasing and the quality of food very good. We made good use of the swimming pool facilities.

Well reccomended, missed it within a day!;5;9.07.2009;"Free swimming pool access. Free ping pong access. Fabulous rooms (we stayed in the cheapest). Great location (not in centre of town but it's a small town so it's quick to get to places). Really enjoyable food. However the best aspect by far was the people who worked there. They offered not only a fabulous service but lovely, funny conversation and whenever anything was requested they could, and did, provide it immediately. A very down-to-earth and friendly atmosphere was around and most people that even stayed in the hotel were nice and welcomed you with a \good morning/evening\"".

Lovely Hotel, excellent service and friendly staff.;5;8.03.2009;I stayed at the Lek hotel the first week of March 2009 with my husband and 11 year old son. We stayed in a loft room which in itself was a lovely room but i would of liked a balcony. The hotel is a lovely hotel with friendly staff and great service, the meals are of good quality with plently of choice, it would have been even better if tea/coffee was available in the afternoon after a day on the slopes.The snow conditions were excellent for this time of year and it was still snowing the day prior to leaving. The hotel is only a 5 minute walk to the runs in the resort when you cut through from the back of the hotel, the runs in the resort are all very spacious and not busy ideal for learners.The pool area was lovely ,clean and whirlpool was excellent after a day of bumps and bruises. The only downside to this hotel is it was very quiet in the evening and would of benifited from having a games room/pool table to keep our son occupied.Would definately return to this hotel if we got a bargain likme we did this time.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Brilliant place to stay!;5;16.02.2009;My girlfriend and I had the pleasure of visiting Kranjska Gora in Feb 2009 and stayed for a week at Hotel Lek. I couldn’t be more effusive about either the town or the hotel! Kranjska Gora is a small, picturesque village situated just a few kilometres from the Italian and Austrian borders and offers a good range of Julian Alps pistes. The nursery slopes in particular are fantastic for beginners. When we visited, the town lay under a blanket of snow and the skiing conditions were perfect. This was my first ski trip so I felt spoilt rotten! Hotel Lek has been described here as being some distance from the slopes. Whilst there are closer places to stay, the Lek is only a 10min (max) walk away and the bracing journey in the cold usually actually helped wake me up for my 9am lessons! As others have advised, the 30 Euros charge to store your gear at the Inter Sport lockers is definitely money worth spending. That 10min walk back to the hotel would feel more of a trek should you be carting bulky boots, fiddly poles and skis!We stayed half board. After reading the unflattering reviews of the hotel restaurant beforehand we were pleasantly surprised by the culinary choices. 3 or 4 different dishes every night – not Michelin star grub granted – but the dishes filled you up after a lengthy day of tumbles and knee aching on the slopes.The Lek has an indoor pool and Jacuzzi, which my girlfriend adored. There’s also an adult only sauna area, with another Jacuzzi, 3 saunas and 2 steam rooms. You need to pay 10 Euros to enter this area and the place is ‘European’ i.e. no clothes, so be warned!There’s a fantastic pizzeria within the town that offers humongous-sized servings and many different toppings! Slightly further down the road from there you’ll find a lovely Slovenian restaurant – Pierre Marin (or something!). Substantial portions served there too! There’s a supermarket in town, where you can stock up on water, fruit, lunch etc.A definite must is the Lake Bled trip. One of the most beautiful places I’ve ever seen. Google image it now! We booked via ThomsonSki and found the reps v.helpful and welcome. The package was cheaper than many we researched but I can honestly not think of one negative thing to say about the place – one of my most favourite holidays!;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Superb Hotel - Great Food;5;3.02.2009;"The hotel, is literally a stone's throw from the main part of Kranjska Gora, nice and quiet on an evening and takes about 5 minutes (if that) to walk into centre. You can see the ski slopes from the hotel. It is very picturesque surrounding the hotel. Kranjska Gora itself is so quaint and beautiful. They still had xmas trees up nd xmas lights in the streets, it was like something from a film. So quaint. We decided that kranjska Gora translated to Christmas Town! We have booked to go back for xmas this year!The staff are very friendly and really appreciate it if you can at least say \thank you\"" or \""hello\"" in Slovene.The hotel is the only one in Kranjska Gora that is not part of a chain and our Inghams Rep said we had chosen the best hotel.We had superior rooms with a balcony and they were very spacious. The hotel website photos don't really do them justice. The food was a buffet on a morning and evening meal, served in a beautiful dining room.There was always something to please everyone, even children. You always had a choice of meat, (chicken, turkey, pork, beef, veal) and there was always rice or pasta or potatoes. In the centre is a very well stocked salad bar, with plenty of fresh bread. Choice of really nice deserts, cakes, yogurt, fruit, ice cream. We had a bad experience of food last year in Bulgaria and ended up eating out 5 nights out of 7 so we were cautious of the hotel food this year. We didn't eat out one night this year as it was lovely! We had 3 children aged 9, 14 and 16 and they loved the food. As long as you don't want processed food like fish fingers, burgers, chips etc you will love it. if you do want that then there is a kebab shop and plenty of fast food places on the slopes.The hotel doesn't have a drying room and it rained 2 days when we were there but after asking at reception they offered to put our ski jackets and trousers in the boiler room to dry over night...so helpful.There isn't a fitness room in the hotel (this is advertised in Inghams brochure), which was slightly dissapointing as I needed to run off the food I had eaten!The hotel pool was superb and there is also a small \""massage\"" pool where you can massage your shoulders and aching backs and legs after a day on the slopes. I reall don't have any complaints about the hotel, and would definitely recommend it to anyone, young or old.

Hotel was great one of our party turned 18 whilst there lovely cake supplied and complimentary drinks nice gesture. Hotel is only five minutes walk from piste, would recommend storing ski gear in lockers at hotel Prisank under ski bar at bottom of starter slope,10 euro well spent no treking with snow boots on! Also get off beginners slope as soon as possible other runs in resort are very good with less people and usually more snow. Beautiful country lovely resort, very clean and excellent food. The local supermarket is very good value and has a good range of products so self catering would be another option.Will definitely return.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Fantastic holiday;4;6.01.2009;We stayed at the Lek with our two children aged 5 and 9 over Christmas on a half board basis and thoroughly enjoyed our time. The hotel is situated relatively close to the slopes although it does feel like quite a trek when wearing your ski gear!! It was nice and quiet and our room had a fantastic view overthe mountains.The majority of the staff were helpful and friendly - especially the waiters and cooks! We had a few issues with some of the others but generally if you are patient and polite they will be to. The food was delicious and there was always a wide range to choose from wth something to suit everyone. Some of the reviews have commented on it being 'a bit samey' but what do you expect if they offer you a wide range of 3 meats and fish plus a vegetarian option every evening? A MUST is the nut soup (I wasn't so sure to begin with either) - it was fantastic, i wish i had the receipe!!The ony problem we encountered the whole time we were there was the size and number of beds in the room. There were 4 of us... And only 2 single beds and a single size sofa... I thought there had been a mistake but apparently that was the room we were allocated - and there were no other rooms available in the hotel. As far as we were concerned we had booked a LARGE LOFT ROOM that slept 4 with room for a 5th bed. Eventually we were given a camp bed which in itself was adequate but the room was small before it got in there!! As a result we were squashed in like sardines in a tin for the week. However we didn't let it spoil our holiday and the resort and skiing were fantastic so a good time had by all!;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
OK, but some irritations!;3;29.11.2008;Stayed here for one week before moving-on to Bled.The hotel is situated on a quiet by-pass road, but very close to the resort centre.The better rooms are quite spacious and have great views of the mountains.There is a jacuzzi and pools -these are a little small, but adequate. The sauna incurs a charge.We stayed on a half-board basis, the restaurant is OK, but choices at both breakfast and dinner are a bit limited. Though it is a buffet, it is not really self-service, and some of those serving were not that pleasant. Guests in a hotel should be put at ease, not fee like school-pupils queueing-up for the dinner-lady!Diners are asked not to bring their own drinks into the restaurant with them, and a Slovenian law is quoted as the reason for this.On one occasion, I brought a small bottle of mineral water with me to dinner - to take medicine with - and the head-waiter made a bee-line for me to tell me I couldn't drink the water there. He wasn't rude as such, but his manner was forceful and it was entirely unnecessary, as we were purchasing drinks, anyway. It was difficult to relax at dinner that evening, and left a rather sour taste at meal-times for the rest of our stay. We did complain about this to the Travel Agent upon leaving.The waiters and waitresses, while very well-mannered, were far too anxious to take plates and cutlery from guests, often before we had finished. One got the impression they felt they had to be doing something as the head-waiter (yes, the same one) looked-on. Dining just never felt relaxed.There is an internet terminal in reception, which is free, otherwise guests who want access in the hotel have to purchase paid-for public wireless access.Reception staff were generally very pleasant and the hotel is certainly clean.Kranjska Gora itself is a very pleasant little town and a great base for walking, hiking, etc, or just chilling with the nice scenery.I'll certainly come back to Kranjska Gora, but don't intend to stay in the Lek again - there are more enjoyable hotel experiences here than this one.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Very nice hotel;4;30.06.2008;Quite a big hotel, we booked a room with balcony which was nice to sit out on. Views were great, but the room was very good too! Buffet breakfast and dinner, which although it did have a lot of choice was a bit disappointing quality wise - but that is being picky! The whirlpool was great, as was the whole swimming area although there isn't much room outside for 'lounging'.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Good Value for Money;4;22.03.2008;We have just returned from a weeks stay at the Hotel Lek. First of all the resort of Kranjska Gora. Lovely place. Very scenic. Very laid back feel. We arrived on 15th March to be greeted by very little snow on the slopes (in fact only 2 slopes open, then down to one on the second day). However we were first time skiers so our initial dissappointment about the lack of snow soon faded, there was plenty for us!!We had pre-booked ski school with Intersport Bernik and our instructor was excellent (Petra). Very patient with a good sense of humour. Finally plucked up courage on the last day to ski from the very top. Be careful on the chair lift. Sudden drop resulting in my wife and I falling flat on our faces. Village of Kranjska Gora was very quiet with few restaurants open in mid- March. Great value for money though. Difficult to spend money. Everything pretty cheap.Hotel Lek good. Rooms roomy! with balcony and flat screen TV. Very clean. Staff pleasant. Breakfast fine, dinner dissappointing with poor quality main courses. Swimming pool area excellent. Sauna superb but no costumes allowed!!! When in Rome.......Bar a bit strange. Downstairs out of the way. Nice though, although we were told we were not allowed to play cards?!!Overall though a lovely place, and ideal for new skiiers.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Great;5;21.03.2008;Very pleased with both hotal and staff, lovely and clean and nice and warm after a good days skiing...Food was good always something to pick from and you could always get a snack at the bar, downstairs.Free internet for use for all customers. Nice idea with the dressing gowns and slippers if you use the swimming pool, sanua..Not much in the town, apart from a few bars, supermarket, sport shop;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Comfortable Hotel;4;19.01.2008;We Stayed at the Hotel Lek arriving on the 5th January 2008 for one week we booked through the Thomsons website.Hotel Lek is comfortable, warm,clean, friendly hotel with the added bonus of a good snug bar downstairs and a swimming pool with jacuzzi and sauna.Two things that were disappointing after 4 days we had grown tried of the evening meals as they lacked variety and the transfer time of 3 hours from Salzberg Austria was longer than the flight from Manchester.The Breakfasts were good plently of fibre to boost your energy levels for a full day skiing.The rooms were cleaned every day with fresh towels supplied on a daily basis.Drinks in the hotel were good value approx L1.50 for a beer.The resort overall was great for beginner skiers and the learn to ski package purchased with thomsons was great value for money.It included 12 hours tuition, ski and boot hire and 6 day lift pass for L182 pp.Thomson ski package worked out cheaper than booking through the ski shop in Kranjska Gora.Overall Hotel and Resort i would have to give it a 5*.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
One to remember....;5;4.10.2007;This has got to be one of the nicest hotels i have ever stayed in, i cannot fault it at all. We went over to Kranjska Gora for a long weekend, just to relax and thats exactly what we managed to do, time stood still. The staff were very helpfull and friendly and spoke good english. The outside of the hotel is immaculate with tennis courts, childrens play area and seating. As you enter the reception it is welcoming. We had a superior room with a balcony which overlooked the most fantastic of mountains views you will ever see. The leaves on the trees were changing colour which was stunning. The room was very clean, and i am fussy..i like it nice...cleaners came in everyday to clean and change towels..Breakfast is ok, with enough varieties of food to cater for everybodies taste. We did'nt eat at night in the hotel, went to the village where there is a good selection of restaurants, the Lipa has great pizza, freshly made...the prices for drink and food are very cheap compared to the UK.The swimming pool and big hot tubs are also nice, would be good to relax in there after skiing all day..The hotel is not far from the village about 5 mins walk.The village itself was fairly quiet when we went, it was the slow period after summer and before the skiing starts...we hired a couple of mountain bikes from the Enca lounge, a small coffee/bar in the village run by Jay, a english guy who gave us some good local advise on the area..The biking and walking is second to none..on weekends at this time of year a ski lift takes hardy mountain bikers up the hill to a bike park...its the real deal...great facility..Overall the village is lovelly, very clean and tidy,(this goes for the wholeplace including the airport, no litter anywhere), people friendly, its a rustic, idylic place to stay..i can't wait to go back...;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Great Hotel;5;23.08.2007;We stayed at this hotel for 2 weeks and found it to be excellent in all respects. Our bedroom was great with a large double bed - well 2 singles put together in typical European style - with a separate sitting room with settee and easy chair, minibar, free safe deposit box and TV with over 40 different stations. It was clean, the linen was changed three times a week and the towels as requested. The meals were buffet style but there was a plentiful choice with the eggs cooked to order for breakfast and at least four main courses in the evening. The main swimming pool is large with two ancillary pools one of which had a number of jets of water which could be switched on as required. The staff were always polite, charming and courteous and nothing was too much trouble for them. We had chosen the hotel by using a pin in a list of hotels in the resort but it proved to be an excellent choice.;Hotel Lek;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceHotelLek;Vrshishka cesta 38, Kranjska Gora 4280, Slovenia;46.4815352;13.7814594
Wonderful;5;16.06.2007;The setting is so beautiful, the hotel was absolutely first class. Plentiful and excellent food. Worth upgrading to superior room as we were told windows in cheaper rooms are very small. Our room was lovely with balcony, flat screen TV and mini bar.

Small hotel with big soul;5;12.05.2017;We took four day ski package with HB and ski pass included.As it was the end of March. Ski conditions were good only till noon, but it was quite enough for us skiing 3-4 hours. You have some nice huts on the slopes, wher you can relax, take a drink or food.Hotel is situated few steps away from ski slopes and directly on cross country runs. Regarding hotel, we enyojed every minute of stay, because the hotel offers true familiar athmosphere,( special thanks for this to Miss Tamara), food was great,and we enyojed afternoons at the fire place in lobbby and later on in excellent wellness with outdoor whirpool and panoramic saunaWe plan to book this hotel again.;Rogla Hotel;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceRoglaHotel;Cesta na Roglo 15, Zrece 3214, Slovenia;46.3698028;15.3886596

If you have children go for it! Young couples trying to skii, awason!

Great location;4;19.12.2016;Hotel is located directly on the ski slopes. It has everything you need for a good vacation. Staff is great! Everybody were kind, polite and helpful. Rooms are too small but very clean. Bathrooms are awful. Small in a really bad condition. Luckily there is a Swimming Pool in the basement so we chose to wash ourselves there instead of using the bathroom.The only problem I had was with the person in charge of reservations. I waited for a month to be answered, and it was done after my reservation was confirmed. Nobody answered my mail till I made a phone call and it was not the number that was written on a booking.com contact page. The lady was unpleasant and not very helpful same as mail that was written after I got it.;Rogla Hotel;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceRoglaHotel;Cesta na Roglo 15, Zrece 3214, Slovenia;46.3698028;15.3886596
Catastrophe;1;16.10.2016;The room was terrible. I think there was no maintenance in it for a long time (not sure about cleaning also). The electricity power socket was hanging out of the wall, there was just a screw where the door stopper should be and there was mud and mold in the shower. And dirty water was flowing from the sink and shower.Also stuff was impolite and unfriendly. Especially the guy named Janko at the reception of a wellness centre! ;Rogla Hotel;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceRoglaHotel;Cesta na Roglo 15, Zrece 3214, Slovenia;46.3698028;15.3886596
Even great in the Summer ;4;1.07.2016;We visited Rogla during a crazy heat wave in the city and the cooler fresh air of the mountains was amazingly refreshing. The hotel is nice, friendly staff and good service. The walking paths are great and they have a mountain roller coaster (for 6€ adult) a ride down the mountain gives you a beautiful view and even our 4 year old loved it. Every Sunday in July - August there are activities /music / food a great escape from the city for some fresh air !;Rogla Hotel;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceRoglaHotel;Cesta na Roglo 15, Zrece 3214, Slovenia;46.3698028;15.3886596

Not luxury, but very nice hotel;5;22.03.2016;I've been in Hotel Rogla several times and every time I come back, first of all due to very kind staff. The hotel is not a luxury one, it has grown up from a little old cottage (Stara koèa) which today is the nicest part of the hotel. The meals are delicious and the prices are acceptable. The ski service is very helpful. I like their sauna very much (my favourite in Slovenia).

No as good as last year.;3;6.02.2016;Location was in the old part of the hotel. There you have to pay for robe if you want to use sauna or other spa utilities. Even if you have it on your package deal. If by any chance you got the room in the new part of the hotel you get the robe for free on the same price for the room. (strange) Food was average.

New hotel but staff needs to work;3;14.02.2015;As far as I know, this hotel was opened in late 2014. From outside nothing special, but inside reminds you of a modern cottage. Very nice. Rooms are well equiped and funished so you cant complain here. Why we gave only 3/5 is because of the staff. Sometimes i had a feeling that they were lost and didnt had. A clue what are they doing. Some faults we found:- wellness area doesnt have a sign so you really have a difficulty on finding it- there are no real waitors only students or wannabe waitors- the staff is sometimes rude if you ask them something obvious to them- free wifi isnt working all the time- ...Its a shame because this hotel has potential.

Great family place;4;16.01.2013;"We stayed in Rogla Hotel in January 2013 with 2 kids (age 7 and 3). Our older daughter slept in bunk bed and for our younger daughter we brought mobile bed with us. Staff did not allow us to use their baby cot due to \small size of rooms\"". However we did not want to have somebody sleeping between 2 mattresses and we managed to put mobile bed between our bed and the window. It is a lovely family hotel with excellent food and service. Also, the pool and jakuzzi are very nice, although water inside the pool could be cleaner. The pool is of good size and the water/air are hot. The hotel is very close to the cable car. Basically, Planja/Rogla hotels are in the same building and they are pretty much everything you can find on Rogla resort. Advice - do not stay in Zrece if you plan to ski every day. It is 12 km away from Rogla and the bandy road will make your kids sick. Kids’ playground inside the hotel is small and not very good equipped. But we did not felt as it was missing as all the time kids had something to do.""";Rogla Hotel;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceRoglaHotel;Cesta na Roglo 15, Zrece 3214, Slovenia;46.3698028;15.3886596

Big trouble in little Slovenia;2;5.03.2007;Our faculty trip started in 17th february we were going in Slovenia. Great country , lovely nature... but there were some problems with Ski bus that I have not been familiar with. Offcourse you probably asking yourself what ski bus actually means. Well, thats the bus who connect your hotel with nearest town. In this case that was Zreèe. As hotel guestt you have free ticket for this bus.On february 19th I have reallly special experience. I have came from Rogla to Zreèe, with no problems, but when I was waiting bus to take me back on Rogla, bus driver was came on station like a 20 minutes earlier. I was thrilled, it was freezing outside, and nice, warm bus is here, Hurray !!! But... he was wery unpleasant,when he saw that Im the only passenger and asked me to wait next 20 minutes outside till time to go. Okay, maybe there were some rules that forbide him to taking passengers before time maybe is better for me to sit on the nearest bench an wait. But, the moment when I turn my back to bus was the moment when he was close the door and turn on the engine and take a ride in Rogla way. 20 minutes earlier!!!! Without me!!! Standing there and freezing!!!! With next bus 4 hours later!!!Absolutely unbeleivable!!!!! Later I have find out that he is all the time so unpleasant and rude. However, I have complained when I was much later came into HotelAbout other places and wery nice experiences in Slovenia, next time :)This was just a warning for others;Rogla Hotel;Slovenija;Ski_resort;SlovenijaSmucisceRoglaHotel;Cesta na Roglo 15, Zrece 3214, Slovenia;46.3698028;15.3886596

Delightful place to stay with outstanding service ;4;3.05.2017;The Grand is a very pleasant place to stay. It's an attractive old building, but modernised. We had to change rooms twice, first for unclear reasons, secondly because the curtains wouldn't close, but the staff were so friendly and helpful it didn't matter at all. Our final room was spacious and very comfortable, but oddly shaped and with fewer windows than seemed to make sense, so it was rather dark. The food - we had the buffet breakfast and dinner- were excellent: varied and good quality, despite the rather large scale of the catering. There is a small pool, but guests have access to a much larger one a few minutes away. We had some good and very reasonably priced spa treatments. All the staff, from reception to restaurant to cafe to spa were warm and helpful.

 Ok but not really 4 stars ;3;27.04.2017;Ok, nice hotels, but a bit deficient in the details that make a place a really nice one. Being the main, historical hotel of the thermal complex, it has space for improvement.Service in the room needed reminding (forgot to fully prepare it), saunas and thermal pool is standard, but food is actually really good. Nice park outside and very friendly locals. Basically only quiet Russian visitors. Average age is around 60 as expected in a thermal resort. Nice place to relax, jog and bike.

In need of a little TLC! ;3;20.02.2017;My mother and I visited the hotel regaska after reading about it in the Slovenia guidebook. On arrival you can see why it's called the grand hotel as the view from outside it appears very spectacular with high ceilings and an oldy world feel. Staff at reception, bars and the restuarant were all extremely friendly and happy to speak to us in English. The hotel is ginormous and we were staying in a standard room. Although overall from the outside the hotel was impressive it definitely needed some home improvements. Room was very average and had tired decor. The pool was quite dark and did not feel particular clean when lying on a deck chair round the edge of it. If you're used to going for a spa day in England the quality of the pool was not great in comparison. There was only one pool area with hardly any room round the edge all of which was taken up. There was no jacuzzi just a bubble section of the pool. We stayed half board and for both dinner and breakfast there was a good selection of food although I did find it all quite random. The dinner was set in a grand room but the atmosphere was quite subdued with hardly anyone there and quite low vibes from others. The position of the hotel was good and right next to several walks into the mountains which we took advantage of.;Grand Hotel Rogaska;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceGrandHotelRogaska;Zdravilishki trg 11, Rogaska Slatina 3250, Slovenia;46.2373095;15.639719

I absolutely don't recommend-waste of money!;2;2.02.2017;"There are only two reasons why I didn't rate it with 1 star and that are personel who are really helpful and friendly and the building itself- location and classical architecture. There is absolutely nothing grand about this hotel and it definitely doesn't deserve 4 stars, at best 3. The rooms despite being spacious are worn out, walls are dirty, the carpet had big spots all over it, door handle was damaged and you couldn't close doors properly, the same with window handle (having plastic windows in such a nice building is also big shame) and the \best\"" part are mattresses which are so hard that it was unbearable to sleep- solution that they coud come up with was adding extra blanket on top of mattress like that would help. Seating arrangment in restaurant is not good, except if you like to sit next to strangers. The food is poor, average at best and absolutely not 4 star quality or diversity, taste can be comperable to hospital food. Breakfast is average, juices are disgusting, coffe watery, bread choice poor. Dinner is worse- canteen food, fish that supposed to be grilled was cooked and tastless, side dishes terrible, deserts low quality. The only good thing were salads. Pool size for such a hotel is laughable, water is to cold and pool hydro-massage time shortes i've experienced.Wellness is outdated and fells dirty. I've never seen in any wellness that wall plaster would be peeling off. Chairs for relaxing are uncomfortable and dirty.Parking space is way to small and was full of ice- just an idea but maybe put salt on it and clean it and guests who want can go to ice skate somewhere else.Never again, what they offer for this price is a rip off.""";Grand Hotel Rogaska;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceGrandHotelRogaska;Zdravilishki trg 11, Rogaska Slatina 3250, Slovenia;46.2373095;15.639719
the worse weekend ever!!;1;26.01.2017;I'm a mother of 2 kids who just wanted to relax and sleep for the weekend with my husband and I got the worse bed ever...it was like sleeping in the floor...we told them about the hard beds and they kindly say they will do something about it...what they did was put one blanket more thinking that will help...for sure not.they should have some kinde of dormeo or something like that not a basic blanket.Food for sure not a 4 class hotel...I really dont recommend this hotel...;Grand Hotel Rogaska;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceGrandHotelRogaska;Zdravilishki trg 11, Rogaska Slatina 3250, Slovenia;46.2373095;15.639719
Hotel to recommend;5;13.11.2016;Hotel with 4* is a place to recommend. Very clean, good service with polite and friendly staff. Cosmetic product's from Afrodita are used in wellnes.

Justified value for money! Very relaxing and complete.;5;1.11.2016;I really liked my weekend stay at Grand hotel Rogaška. It is a serious hotel where everything is as it should be. Staff is friendly and polite, room has everything necessary for comfy stay. It is decorated in old Austria style and is persistent and credibile in it. We ate breakfast and dinner. The offer was very rich ~ several fish dishes, meat, vegetable etc. Very wide range of food was offered for breakfast also. Everything we tried tasted very good. Hotel is big and so is the dining room, and I liked that. We also used services of spa. Swimming pool satisfies but could have been bigger. Sauna area is great. There are several small saunas, so there's a big chance you end up only with your companions. This part consist of saunas, shower area, relaxing area and cold bath area. Outside of hotel there is not many things to do.;Grand Hotel Rogaska;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceGrandHotelRogaska;Zdravilishki trg 11, Rogaska Slatina 3250, Slovenia;46.2373095;15.639719
Such a shame for this building ....;2;15.09.2016;"We stayed 3 days in the hotel (15-18 aug). Let me start by saying that staff is friendly and welcoming at reception and restaurant. And that the front of the building clearly shows the grandeur of the past century ! Unfortunately only on the outside ... The inside is a different story. We booked a standard double room with parkview. After checking in we took a bagage trolley at the entrance to bring our luggage to our room at first floor. This was clearly a wrong choice as bagage trolleys were too big to fit in the elevator...The room was outdated (washbasin stop was broken, carpet was worn out and dirty - even in the hallway -, mold on silicone fillings in shower). In the evening we went for a meal (half board) in the hotel restaurant (self-service). Apparently food is prepared by a famous chef ; he/she must have been in holiday or sick... Focus is on quantity and certainly not on quality of the food. If you like mountains full of lukewarm food, this is the place to be ! I can actually state that this is the worst food I have eaten in Slovenia ; needless to say that we didn't eat there anymore during the rest of our stay. The parking lot has space for +/-30 cars (if you can park very close) and this is NOT big enough for all the guests. We needed to ask several times at reception where we could park our car as there wasn't any space left ; they helped us then but we needed to leave car in a space where it was a nuisance to other guests leaving the ridicously small parking lot.We assumed that somebody of your staff would ask as how our stay was when we paid our hotel bill but no... This is why I write this review now, hopefully management will act and make this hotel great again ! This wonderful historic building deserves more !";Grand Hotel Rogaska;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceGrandHotelRogaska;Zdravilishki trg 11, Rogaska Slatina 3250, Slovenia;46.2373095;15.639719
Great food, quiet environment;4;15.09.2016;I stayed at the resort at the end of August 2016 and it was not crowded at the time. It was very quiet, with the exception of an outdoor event that took place one night but was over by 11 p.m. Food was amazing, lots of variety for dinner and breakfast and very tasty. The front desk staff were very helpful. The room was in the older section of the building and was fairly clean and basic and the beds were comfortable but the pillows were not. The only drawback that would prevent me from coming back was the fact that the outdoor pools were about a 7 minute walk away from the hotel. Their indoor pool was not safe to use after dark. It was not lit properly, either from the ceiling or from within the pool. You couldn't see the steps or a person under water. The water chemistry was off, making my eyes burn. Chloramines were high which smelled like the typical chlorine-like odour when there isn't enough chlorine or not enough fresh water added.;Grand Hotel Rogaska;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceGrandHotelRogaska;Zdravilishki trg 11, Rogaska Slatina 3250, Slovenia;46.2373095;15.639719
Perfect weekend;5;7.08.2016;I spent a wonderful weekend in this hotel. It looks nice in photos, but, believe me, it's much better in real. Everything is perfect there! Rooms are great, nice, bright, well furnished, with nice new carpets and big comfortable bed. Bathroom is also big enough and well equipped. Food is excellent! We had half board and I can tell, all of us really enjoyed eating breakfast and dinner. The restaurant is big. During summer you can eat on the balcony looking at a gorgeous park.There is also good spa in hotel with nice indoor swimming pool, saunas and relaxing area. All of that you can use for free as a hotel guest. My suggestion is to take a massage treatment. You should pay it, but believe me, it's something that will make your vacation complete. The staff is very polite and hospitable. They speak English, German, Italia, Russian, Slovenian, Croatian... Grand Hotel Rogaska is definitely the place that I will visit again.;Grand Hotel Rogaska;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceGrandHotelRogaska;Zdravilishki trg 11, Rogaska Slatina 3250, Slovenia;46.2373095;15.639719
Great hotel for relaxing;4;1.07.2016;The hotel is located in charming village Rogaška Slatina. The hotel was absolutely great. Nice and clean room with comfortable beds . The food was very good with a huge selection.The food, the atmosphere and the lovely spa area is great. The hotel had a free WiFi with decent speed.We had half-board with breakfast and dinner. The breakfast was really good with sausages and bacon, eggs, cheese, pancakes, cottage cheese, fresh fruits and whatnot. The buffet dinner had a huge selection: soups, main course which you could choose from fish, meat and vegetarian options, salad buffet and dessert.The only minus I could find was that hotel has no outdoor swimming pool and sunbathing area. The outdoor pools (included in price) are available approximate 500 meters away in the Thermal Riviera Rogaška - it is an easy walk. Whole service including check-in and check out were done very professionaly. Looking at the the price paid for the half board you get very good value! We will for sure return to Rogaška Slatina and stay at Grand Hotel Rogaška Slatina..;Grand Hotel Rogaska;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceGrandHotelRogaska;Zdravilishki trg 11, Rogaska Slatina 3250, Slovenia;46.2373095;15.639719
Excellent stay and services;5;21.06.2016;Few resorts could ever be as healthy, green and luxurious as the Rogaska Slatina Slovenian SPA resort. The moment that I actually saw the place, I couldn't believe how big, green and well kept it was. I decided to stay at the Grand Hotel Rogaska and It's a hotel that really looks like more of a big grand building than anything else, and it manages to have the fantastic accommodations that you would expect from a hotel like this.When I went on this vacation, I mainly just wanted to relax for few days. I wasn't interested in sightseeing this time around. The Rogaska Slatina Slovenian SPA resort was perfect for that. I managed to get as many wellness treatments as I could, and I really recommend everything. You honestly completely feel like a different person the moment that you get back from the spa at the Rogaska Slatina. The therapists and the technicians at the spa really seemed to know what they were doing, and I immediately felt more relaxed the moment that I was in their hands. Really, I only have good things to say about the staff members of the Rogaska Slatina Slovenian SPA resort in general.The staff members at a place like this can make or break it, which everyone knows. In this case, the Rogaska Slatina Slovenian SPA resort really had excellent staff members. I thought that all of them were really friendly and attentive. They really knew everything that was going on, and they could answer all of your questions without your having to try to Google everything every five seconds, and that makes all the difference if you're on vacation and you're trying not to stare at your phone the whole time. I really felt like the staff members could handle anything, and that makes a big difference if you're abroad and you really want to make sure that you're in good hands. Just a small example I needed to find a pet grooming service for my westie and Andrea at the reception organised everything for me!The view from my hotel room was fantastic, I chose to get a good size room that was called 'Premium' and from 22 to 40 Square meter. The room was luxurious and I really felt like I was very comfortable there. Bed super comfy and bathroom of good size. Wifi free everywhere.People don't necessarily need to get all of the most expensive things at the Grand Hotel Rogaska in order to really enjoy themselves there. This is just the sort of resort where people are going to have a great time anyway. I thought that the food at the Grand Hotel was great, with fantastic choice and great quality! The Grand Hotel Rogaska has everything: a pool, massage services, and rooms that are so comfortable you could really have fun there. I recommend this resort to anyone.;Grand Hotel Rogaska;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceGrandHotelRogaska;Zdravilishki trg 11, Rogaska Slatina 3250, Slovenia;46.2373095;15.639719

Worst 4* hotel I have ever been;1;15.05.2016;Grand Hotel Rogaška has 3 parts, Grand, Styria and Strosmayer. All of them doesn't deserve 4 stars. I spent two night in Strosmayer on the first flor. Room was so small that it has only space to cross to the bad between bad and desk. Very old and bad. No refrigerator in the room. Breakfast is served from 7-10 but if you come at 9:30 you will not find much to eat. For dinner everything is without taste at all and you will pay 5€ for beer?! If you see the price in Elaphusa (Brac Island Croatia) or Melia in Umag ( real 4* and 5*) you will see that beer cost les then 3€!!! Those hotels are on seaside in expensive part of Croatia.

Even SPA although with a small pool have Austro Hungarian empire feeling.Stuff is very nice and helpful, but my advice is not to be late at breakfast as you will find lesser choice of food.My recommendation to management is to replace the curtains.

Started off a little disappointed, ended very good and enjoyable.;4;2.03.2016;In the beginning we were a little disappointed in the staff, but it all sorted out quickly, so we really enjoyed the rest of the stay.- The hotel is grandiose its big, specious and has a lot of character but it would need a little bit of renovation (the walls and bathrooms), but nothing major. - The staff in the restaurant, bar and wellness are so nice, that you want to give them a hug :)- The food is nothing short of amazing! We had half-board and when we come back we will definitely get full board. (I was amazed by the preperation of fish, in other hotels they are always over cocked or burned, but here they were just right, compliments to the chef.)- The wellness is nice, the pool is small but still enough room to have a swim, the saunas are nice and specious, we also had a massage and a mineral bath and it was wonderful.- When we were there, there was not a lot of guest, so maybe the situation is different if it is crowded, but we very much enjoyed the stay.Would recommend for a nice get away, because there is a loooot of things to see and visit in the area.;Grand Hotel Rogaska;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceGrandHotelRogaska;Zdravilishki trg 11, Rogaska Slatina 3250, Slovenia;46.2373095;15.639719

Rooms average. Breakfast was plentiful and good. Coffee a little cold. The indoor pool was good, the jets gave an amazing massage. The water was not warm enough.

Just from Rogaska;5;18.09.2015;For the fifth year running my wife and me spent our holidays in Rogaska Slatina. While planning the trip there was no any doubt that we should stay in Grand Rogaska Hotel (GR). In our view the Hotel meets the highest requirements. Excellent and various cuisine from the renowned Italian chef. Fabulous restaurant and Crystal Hall with interior of the beginning of the XX c. Most of the staff speaking fluent English, Russian, German and Italian. Cleaning every morning very fast and efficient. Upon request without any hesitation or delay two additional bath towels to attend a swimming pool. Although there is a cosy small swimming pool with a spa area in the Hotel itself we used to attend the Rogaska Riviera Complex with four thermal pools (three in open air and one huge inside) and a wonderful whirlpool. Riviera is located at 6-7 min walking distance. What is especially precious that the guests of GR enjoy a free entrance into Riviera. And of course a beautiful building of the Hotel of the imperial architecture of the Habsburgs’ era. All these create special spiritual atmosphere which strongly facilitate your health recovery. Strongly recommend! Next year only to Grand Rogaska (hopefully, it will not be closed for a reconstruction by a new owner).;Grand Hotel Rogaska;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceGrandHotelRogaska;Zdravilishki trg 11, Rogaska Slatina 3250, Slovenia;46.2373095;15.639719

The latter two deserve special praises: the quality and diversity of the food served during breakfast, lunch and dinner were excellent as well as the service. The Beauty & Spa Centre provides modern face and body treatments of high quality, but there is one real gem in that place, Imilda, a highly professional massage therapist from the Philippines, whose treatment you must not miss and, if possible, book in advance. Her cup massage, therapeutic back massage and feet massage are to die for.

It is a lie;1;15.06.2015;This hotel advertised to be hot spring hotel. Their brochure stated that the thermal pool is a few minutes walk. It turned out that the thermal pool is a separate identity - a public thermal pool, not part of the hotel, and you have to walk 1500 feet in a open and public road to reach it. The pictures in the hotels.com showed the thermal pool as part of the hotel which is incorrect. So if you are thinking of a romantic get-away, stay away from the this and all other hotels in this area.

a little Slovenian Catherine's Palace;4;10.06.2015;"Just a one night stay and opted for the standard room. These do not have air conditioning and are located in the connected former Styria and Stossmayer Hotel buildings. Superior, with A/C in the Grand building is 40euro more.

Several dry saunas of varying temperature, a steam room (other not operating), heated tiled loungers (ask for a sheet!!!), a couple of warmer whirlpools. Actually very nice and relaxing.Food. Breakfast adequate in scope and good quality but OJ was awful (?Tang?). Dinner a high quality abundant spread with fish, pork, chicken, beef, pasta choices, plenty of salads, cheeses and dessert. Considering price point, outstanding. And dining outside was lovely. Wait staff a bit stiff with limited English but ours warmed up considerably when we met her half way in Italian. Beverages inexpensive.A Slovenian a Capella group in the concert hall was a Friday evening treat.I was told by reception that in November further renovations will make it a 5 star.Note this is a package spa vacation hot spot for Russians, not that it mattered, just diluted the I-am-in-Slovenia factor.There must be an easier way to drive in but our SIXT rental's GPS took us on a circuitous, hilly, narrow lane ride through beautiful countryside.""";Grand Hotel Rogaska;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceGrandHotelRogaska;Zdravilishki trg 11, Rogaska Slatina 3250, Slovenia;46.2373095;15.639719

Second time we were in the building where is spa located, but room was in the ground floor corridor and it could be really noisy since all guests are walking there.We loved dining area, it can't be found on many places.

Wonderfull Slovenian experience;4;17.01.2015;We came to stay for two nights and was focuses on spa & wellness section with thermal water which was amazing. The hotel and spa staff are very friendly and available. Inside pool and spa itself are not so big, but they are not at all crowdy, you can have your peace. The food was just excellent. Anyone can find several meals for both breakfast or dinner. Restaurant staff are always ready to serve you and the chefs kept looking if everything was alright. The hotel is very old still renovated for nowadays guests but hotel managment should take care to reduce noise from the hall which can be annoying.We are looking forward to visit Rogaška Slatina again because we presume the best experience of it is on warm months with many possibilities in the area, expecially wine routes.;Grand Hotel Rogaska;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceGrandHotelRogaska;Zdravilishki trg 11, Rogaska Slatina 3250, Slovenia;46.2373095;15.639719
Very good food!;4;4.01.2015;We stayed here for new years eve, and although it was cold and snowy had a good relaxing stay, exactly what we were looking for.

10 days stay aimed at the spa;3;27.12.2014;I found the hotel because of a suggestion by Lidl. I thought Lidl would make kind of quality filter, maybe I was wrong. I checked in on Dec. 23, and it has been a very bad impact, because meal was very bad: a slice of veal was hart more that a shoe sole, because absolutely overcooked, and you could ear the creak at cutting and at chewing. Veggies with a terrible taste, soup that fluid as water.The evening after, christmas eve, eating was acceptable, then again worse, but better that the first time. I did order red wine, and the bottle you can find in a supermarket for 4 euros has been billed 25 euros. No big bottle of water (being a half board it would have been normal, to me), but only 33cl for close to 2 euros each. Apart of that, structure is quite good, and thermal water with magnesium, even in the pool, is magic for the health. Conclusion: keep expectation low, but a visit is worth.;Grand Hotel Rogaska;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceGrandHotelRogaska;Zdravilishki trg 11, Rogaska Slatina 3250, Slovenia;46.2373095;15.639719
Satisfied;5;17.12.2014;First we got the room with a bad view (the wall). I asked if we could get another room, and we got one with a view over a park free of charge (normally 30 eur more). The pool and saunas were mostly empty, so we had a lot of privacy and fun. The food was excellent. Breakfast with endless possibilities, and dinner with great menus especially for meat eaters. Staff was very friendly, always keen to supply us with any information we needed. Other guests were mostly foreign adults (i guess Russian) No one says hello, which was kinda strange to me, but that's normal in hotels I've been told. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to get a high-end hotel experience.;Grand Hotel Rogaska;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceGrandHotelRogaska;Zdravilishki trg 11, Rogaska Slatina 3250, Slovenia;46.2373095;15.639719

The reception and spa staff were friendly, restaurant was excellent quality (probably the best breakfasts we have ever had), and the spa facilities were clean and functional.

ok, but needs improvement;3;1.09.2014;"This was once a \grand hotel\"", but those days are gone. It seems the hotel was modernized in the 90s, and it is time to renovate again - especially the rooms. We had a standard room with a view of the park; the room was ok. It was clean enough, except for the mold in the shower stall. The bed was also ok, except that it was rather low - only 30 cm from the floor may be a bit difficult for guest with back problems. We booked breakfast and dinner (both buffet style) and found the food very disappointing. We only ate dinner there the first night and then went to restaurants in the area. The staff was generally friendly and helpful. The small pool and the sauna area were both adequate and clean.

Great hotel, poor service;3;8.07.2014;"The hotel itself is very beautiful and the entire buidling is old but very well maintained. However, the service was bad and the staff seemed really uninterested and unwilling to go an extra mile. We had a hotel spa coupon each and decided to use it on our last day. We went there one hour before check-out as the reception guy told us we can prolong our stay in the room for a while until the spa coupon service is done, all we needed to do is alert the staff in the spa. However, as we got to the spa, the woman working there was really reluctant and gave an impression it was a bother to her. Needless to say, the entire service was performed with a really bad attitude. Also, when we asked the front desk staff if they could shovel the way to our snowed in car so we can get home, this 4-star establishment was surprised at our request and we saw other guests shoveling show by themselves, which seemed really unbeliavable. Don't expect to be able to go into the adjacent hotel Donat spa wearing nothing but robe as they do not write anything to your room with an odd excuse \it's a completely different hotel\"". so you need to carry around your wallet if you want to use services in other places, which is really a nuisance.""";Grand Hotel Rogaska;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceGrandHotelRogaska;Zdravilishki trg 11, Rogaska Slatina 3250, Slovenia;46.2373095;15.639719
Cosy calm stay in Rogaska;4;4.06.2014;We've stayed in the hotel for two weeks. The location of the hotel is excellent, especially for those who come to Rogaska to drink healing water. The food is high quality. Rooms are spacious and clean, but the furniture is pretty simple. The staff is very helpful and friendly. What we didn't like is hotel's indoor swimming pool - it is small with very poor ventilation, so that the air seems to be very close. Also, spa is decorated quite in a simple way, so that you don't feel entering special spa environment. We would recommend the hotel as a very good value for money.;Grand Hotel Rogaska;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceGrandHotelRogaska;Zdravilishki trg 11, Rogaska Slatina 3250, Slovenia;46.2373095;15.639719
Short break in April;4;18.04.2014;My wife and kids stayed here for a few weeks in Easter. I joined then for 4 days. The Hotel has a great location right in the main square, beside the medical centre. The hotel was very nice, with an air of slightly faded grandeur (not a criticism, more of a compliment). The room we stayed in was extremely large, and esily coped with the four of us. The restaurant is a buffet affair, and the food was of good quality, with plenty of choice. The waiters and waitresses were efficient and friendly.The hotel has a very nice spa as you would expect, with a nice swimming pool and suana, steam room facilicities.I can't really think of any major negatives, and would definitely recommend it.Rogaska itself is a smallish town. The hotels are set away from the town itself. There is not that much to do other than walk around, but there are indeed some lovely short walks up into the surrounding hills.I would definitely recommend the sightseeing tour in the little road train. Sounds a bit strange, but it is a lot of fun.

Pleasant surprise;5;17.01.2014;"We like the hotel very much! I stayed with my family in Grand Hotel Rogaska and I was very surprised how much they offer even though Rogaska is a health resort at the first place. My mother stayed with her husband here in late spring time and she said they had a great time, many things to see and the service is excellent. She was right, I also choose Grand Hotel Rogaska to spend part of my vacation with my family. Now I wish we stayed longer JAs already my mother said, the service is excellent, the staff very nice, they even greeted me in the elevator. Very nice touch. The food was also very good, a lots of things to choose among in the buffet, even my children, age of 5 and 8 were pleased with it and I tell you – that does not happen very often J I also had a chance to visit spa in the hotel, very nice to see, I also had a massage, great one, it was something with banana leaves included, I have not seen it before, but the feeling was amazing. My husband was also very pleased, he had some health issues, so the Donat water helped him; there are also some springs in the nature, near the hotel, we were also told about it by the staff. All in all, great decision of mine, I would recommend it to all who love to travel and seek for a perfect place to relax.";Grand Hotel Rogaska;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceGrandHotelRogaska;Zdravilishki trg 11, Rogaska Slatina 3250, Slovenia;46.2373095;15.639719

The place to stay in Rogaska!;5;20.10.2013;I had a pleasure of staying at the hotel during my business trip and it was a 'grand' experience.The hotel has by far the most glamorous building in the whole Rogaska, I was told by staff that is has 150 years - a beautiful piece of history! I loved the Cristal Hall and I am so pleased to see that they organise various events there almost every week - this room is a piece of art so be sure to see it! Would look stunning for a wedding! The hotel is also a 1-2 min walk to a medical centre which is very convenient. Another great aspect is the stunning Spa with many facilities and excellent standards (entry is included in your hotel's stay so be sure to visit). There is a large thermal pool, thermal jacuzzi, various different types of saunas (I think 6 or 7!), relaxation room with great heated chairs, water and juices station and extremely well-equipped gym. I also went for a facial in the Spa, and although prices are on the international lever than 'Slovenian' level, it's definitely worth it. They use very effective Swiss cosmetics that are a base for every treatment and each treatment starts with skin consultation which is great as I know my skins get what it needs the most.Finally, the food selection is really excellent. Breakfast has the standards of hotel's in the western Europe where you even have a chef cooking omelettes from scratch. Lots of healthy options as well! Lunch and dinner buffet selection changes every day (even cold, salad section) which means there is always a variety of choice and no repetition. Lovely desserts as well!Of course, great staff makes a great hotel and this is a case in here. You can see that staff genuinely care about your stay and always welcomed you with a smile on their face. Thank you very much for a lovely stay!

Great spa hotel, great people, great country!;5;28.08.2013;We drove to Slovenia from Austria and we absolutely fell in love with Rogaska Slatina the very first min we saw it! Green heart of Europe I'd call it! The Grand Hotel Rogaska was as lovely as the small city itself. Very clean and comfortable rooms, excellent central location, short 2-5 mins walk to the Medical Center with famous mineral water Donat, easy short access to everything around. The hotel is old style, I frankly don't remember when was the last time I opened the hotel door with a key, not a card. :) TV was old but had lot's of international channels. But with all comforts and good maintenance it was just fine. A/C was working properly, which was very important in August and we loved those little chocolates on our pillows EVERY DAY – what a nice touch!Hotel personnel and waiters were very friendly and spoke good Russian and English. We stayed on half board basis which means breakfast and dinner and it was just perfect. The reason I'm skipping the lunch staying in places like Rogaska is that I want to take a chance to try some authentic local food aside from traditional hotel buffet. The hotel food was excellent - great selection of everything you may want for a nice breakfast and full dinner. There was a beautiful terrace overlooking the park where you can sit with a cup of coffee in the mornings or green tea and some desert after your dinner in the evening. Very relaxing stay, no problems at all and amazingly friendly Slovenians! Make sure you check a tourist information center right across the park and book a ticket to a tourist train that goes to Olimje during the summer season. With a Russian-English-Italian-etc. speaking guide you will visit the Baroque parish church and the third oldest pharmacy in Europe, a chocolate museum, Haler brewery and pub and a deer farm at Jelenov greben. Unforgettable trip!I would definitely return and I'll recommend this place to everyone.;Grand Hotel Rogaska;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceGrandHotelRogaska;Zdravilishki trg 11, Rogaska Slatina 3250, Slovenia;46.2373095;15.639719
Warm receipt;4;26.07.2013;The ceilings are high (~5m), so the room is well ventilated even without AC. The room was facing the forest, so it was heated by sun only the first part of the day. The afternoon hours were cool and quiet. However, the parking is right under the windows, so some unpleasant visitors fiddling with their cars during the rest hours can disturb you.As was mentioned, the breakfast is rich, but the dinner food is finished quickly, so you need to wait sometimes for refill.The support staff is very friendly and are making their best to help you with a smile.

Beware from Hotel Styria and from Grand Hotel Rogaska;1;30.06.2013;"We booked Hotel Styria through Venere.com although most of the information we read and pictures before making our choice were based on Booking.com. According to Booking the double room in Hotel Styria is air conditioned. In Venere airconditioning is not mentioned. Price of the room was the same at both suppliers but since when booking with Venere we had the option to cancel while with Booking there was no such option we chose to book with Venere. When we arrived at Hotel Styria we got a room without air conditioning. At the reception we were told that there are no airconditioned rooms in Hotel Styria but in the other wing of the same building, called \Grand Hotel\""; they have air conditioned rooms. It's important to understand that there are actually three Hotels, with different names and different decoration and prices which are practically only 3 wings of the same Hotel, with the same reception, the same dining room and the same low quality of maintainance.The lady at the reception told us that they know there is a mistake with the information on Booking, we were not the first customers who were mislead.As the weather was extremly hot we had to pay for the upgrade to an air conditioned room. When we were led into the room the air conditioner made sounds as if it was working, actually it was only circulation of air and no cooling for the whole night, so that the noise of the air conditioner cost us another 76euro!!!! The original prioce was 80 euro. The rooms in both wings are not clean, black mould in the bath, and all the decoration as well as the bed are worn out and old. Since there was no B&B option we had half board. Dinner was not tasty, not enough food at the time we were in the dining room and staff was rude.

Central and comfortable;5;10.10.2012;We have stayed for 10 days in August and were satisfied with everything. The hotel is in the very heart of the health resort, 3 minutes to the medical center – and if the weather isn’t friendly, you can reach it through the passage that goes through the nearby Grand Donat hotel.Although there were three of us in one room, which meant extra-bed, it wasn’t too crowded even like that – the room was very spacious. We had a hill-view room, which actually meant road-view, but it never bothered us – the road is not very busy, and we had no problem sleeping with our windows open. Air conditioning was working properly, which was very appreciated, as we had +35-36 C every day. Every day after doing our room our chambermaid left a little chocolates on our pillows – a nice touch! A strong point is the hotel’s food. It was really great – we took half-pension and enjoyed the cuisine immensly. It may not be too complicated, but cooked with good products and in ten days the dishes never repeated itself and every lunch you had a choice of five main courses. My personal favourite was however the beef broth, which was present every lunch and was the best broth I ever tasted.The hotel swimming pool included in the price was not big, but sufficient for a short relaxing swim or for a dive after sauna: it could be renovated though. Bathrobes were provided in the room for free. Also included in the price is Rogaska Riviera swimming pools complex, which is about 10 walking minutes away from the hotel.The small but sufficient supermarket Mercator was 5 min walk from the hotel.;Grand Hotel Rogaska;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceGrandHotelRogaska;Zdravilishki trg 11, Rogaska Slatina 3250, Slovenia;46.2373095;15.639719

Lovely hotel, wonderful staff!;4;8.09.2012;My husband, 6 month old and I stayed here for five days for a conference and it was wonderful! The room was a very good size as was the bathroom- we had friends staying at the Sava, and although the decor is much more modern our room was twice and a bit more in size!The staff were amazing, they were the cherry on top! Every request was promptly dealt with, our room was cleaned regularly, and the restaurant staff were wonderful! They were so friendly and they spoilt us with their hospitality! We, especially my 6 month old, miss the attention, warmth and friendliness of Nives, Maria and Laura - if the hotel managers are reading this- give them a payrise! (We did have dinner a few times at the sava with our friends and although the menu was much more varied there, the staff were not as friendly, and didnt seem to communicate with each other- we paid in advance for our meal as we were not guests there and although we showed staff the receipt we were bothered at least 3 times and told we needed to pay by various waiters- clearly communication between each other was a problem) The gym was adequate (according to my husband an avid bodybuilder), saunas and spa facilities nice. The indoor pool was ok- but the outdoor pool which grand rogaska guests can use free of charge, €7 otherwise, was great! Only a 5 min walk away, with 2 large outdoor heated pools, lots of sunbeds and a small pool great for the little one.Although Slovenia is an unlikely holiday destination for a British tourist I would definitely go back- everything there is warm- weather, people, food , and it is a beautiful country!;Grand Hotel Rogaska;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceGrandHotelRogaska;Zdravilishki trg 11, Rogaska Slatina 3250, Slovenia;46.2373095;15.639719

Our room was very clean, with a tv and a mini-bar. The bathroom was large and new and towels were good. We also got a bathrobe. The bed was comfortable and it was very quiet at night - a great place to rest and recover. We also had wi-fi in the room for a limited number of hours daily. We payed for a half board, which is usually breakfast and dinner, but they allowed us to choose between dinner and lunch daily. The food was tasty and there was always a variety of it. There were always several meat dishes (chicken, veal, pork, ...) as well as fish and a vegetarian dish. There was a large salad bar, a lot of fresh fruit and cakes, two different soups... Breakfast was also very good. This hotel has a small swimming pool, a fitness room and a very nice spa center. Guests of this hotel can also use pools of Rogaska riviera - 3 outside pools and one large inside pool. There are also various water massagers and a whirlpool. There were 2 lifeguards, but pools are not deep (1.35 m if I remember correctly).There are a lot of activities (walks, workouts, concerts, shows,...), but remember to bring a sweater or a jacket, because it gets chilly in the evening even in the summer. We liked Rogaska Slatina because there was a lot to do, it was never crowded and everyone was nice. I recommend it even if you don't have health problems, because this is a great place to get some rest.I also stayed at the Bellevue hotel (4*) at Mariborsko pohorje and it was slightly better (but doesn't have a pool), but I would say that Bellevue is 5* and Strossmayer is really 4*.;Grand Hotel Rogaska;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceGrandHotelRogaska;Zdravilishki trg 11, Rogaska Slatina 3250, Slovenia;46.2373095;15.639719

Really great room;4;18.10.2016;Bioterme are really far away from the cities, in the small village. We were surprised when we saw that the large spa, and thousands of cars in the parking lot and very crowded at the pools. Pools because of this unfortunately are not the cleanest, but there is a smaller pool for hotel guests only. The food is excellent, and in the restaurant can be ordered thermal water.

Nice small spa;5;28.03.2016;We enjoy six days stay in Bioterme. Nice, clean and big room. Food was good (we had breakfast and dinner) and since it is self service you can eat as much as you can. :) Prices overall are acceptable (not too high, but they could be lower). There is also always place to park your car (in front of the hotel, payable garage or gravel parking place across the road). Outside of the hotel you do not have a lot to do since there is only a small village near by (15 minutes walk) with small shop, two bars an one restaurant. But the nature is beautiful.

Peaceful weekend;5;14.09.2015;I spent a lovely weekend here! Our room was clean and bright with comfortable beds and big shower. Staff was very nice. I really like the bio concept of the place and that they are serving food from fresh, locally produced ingredients. They built a special outdoor pool for hotel guests so you always have some peace and privacy even if the main pool is crowded. If you want some pampering they offer different kinds of massages - you can make a reservation at the reception. My favourite part: sauna with comfy relaxation area and big private terrace. Make sure to avoid going there on Saturdays because it's very crowded.;Hotel Bioterme;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceHotelBioterme;Moravci v Slov. goricah 34, 9243 Mala Nedelja, Slovenia;46.5163372;16.0494948

We used the restaurant on one occasion & the food was very nice, with one of the best coffees we had during our stay in Slovenia.

Positively surprised;5;7.04.2015;So having in mind that i read not the best reviews, i did not have any expectations...But after our arrival, i was really impressed by the way the hotel looked. Really nicely designed, ful of natural light and the most important, the room was so so spacious and really well designed, so i was really excited when we entered our room. The pool area is really big, though during the holidays it was ful of daily viditors, so we had a bit of problem with swimming. But if you're thinking of going on holidays with a small child, this is the best place, the water is really hot, not warm almost too hot for someone, they also happen to have a pool for babies and what's even better, they have also the toys there, so my baby was really happy happy. Regarding the food, the variety is not huge, but then you need to consider that it is also not a huge hotel, but the best part of eating was probably breakfast. Regarding the partying and night life, i can not tell you much, as it says, that the hotel is located in the middle of nowhere, so if you're looking for a night life, you will be disapointed, but for families, this is really a nice place to stay, perhaps even better in summer where they have also more pools available outside. The only bad thing i must express is probably that there is no wifi in the room, just cable internet. But overall i was really happy to stay at Bioterme hotel.;Hotel Bioterme;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceHotelBioterme;Moravci v Slov. goricah 34, 9243 Mala Nedelja, Slovenia;46.5163372;16.0494948

There is an outdoor swimming complex. Place that you and your children will enjoy. Wellness section is isolated so that you can really relax. Food is ok, not the best you had, but there is a buffet and you can always make a selection that will tame your hunger.

We knew there was a thermal area with pools/saunas etc but what we didn't know was that it was also a rest and rehabiliation centre for older people. It was a very different dynamic to what we are use to. Getting past this Hotel Vita has very nice facilites, we all had massages which were very resonably priced. The food was pretty good with a different buffet selection for dinner every evening. The rooms were tiny and very warm, we asked twice for our air con to be fixed but it never happened!! ended up spending as much time as possible out of the room to avoid getting cabin fever.

paradise;5;13.04.2015;Dobrna is a little picturesque village in Slovenia. Dobrna spa or therme is the oldest spa in Slovenia. We were told that the park is some 600 years old and it has a kind of forest next to the park. It took me a long time to write this review. Because, at first I tought that maybe it was euphoria and as months went by I understood that it's by far the best spa I ever visited. Hotel park is old renovated building and it is pet friendly. Confortable, very clean and with amazing staff. Hotel itself has no pool but it is 5 minutes walkin distance and it is included in the price.

Old charm, good value.;3;17.10.2014;"We recently spent 2 nights at this hotel while touring this area of Slovenia. Dobrna is an old spa town, and there are several period hotels to choose from, of various archetectural styles of which one is quite elegant. The hotels are located along a quiet road which wanders up a stream in a park-like setting among gardens and walkways with huge mature gorgeous trees. We did not have a reservation, but were able to get a room on walk-in. We liked the look of the hotel from the front, and inside it was about what we expected, older, but well kept and very clean. The room was average size and the bathroom as well; everything was in good condition and clean. The hotel had free WiFi in the room. We booked the room \half-board\"" with breakfast and dinner included for a good rate. Both meals were served buffet style with plenty of food and choices, but don't think of it as gourmet. We did not come here for the spa facilities nor did we use them. The location made it convenient for us to visit both Velenje to the north about 15 minutes, and Celje to the south about 30 minutes, without having to change hotels, and that worked well for us.

On the trails around you can make nice afternoon hikes and afterwards enjoy evening massage.;Hotel Zdravilisce Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceHotelZdravilisceLasko;Zdraviliska cesta 4, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1598636;15.2323511
weekend in Lasko;4;7.04.2015;The wife and I spent a weekend at the Hotel Spa Lasko.We had a room with a view of the river Savinja (surcharge).Pools are great, a sauna in the old part of the hotel should be restored. My wife took a massage and was very pleased. Breakfast and dinner were at a high level (multiple choice dishes and fruit). The rooms were clean and spacious.;Hotel Zdravilisce Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceHotelZdravilisceLasko;Zdraviliska cesta 4, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1598636;15.2323511
Hotel organizes teenage birthday parties on the pool;3;18.07.2014;Hotel is on a nice location, with sufficient facilities, open pool with thermal water our favorite, but birthday party was held on the pool for a couple of hours. During that time, it was nearly impossible for guests of the hotel to relax and to use the pool in a proper way. Meals were usual, nothing special, but ok for the hotel of this rank.;Hotel Zdravilisce Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceHotelZdravilisceLasko;Zdraviliska cesta 4, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1598636;15.2323511
Enjoy;5;22.05.2014;During our stay for four days we really enjoyed. Pools are great, service is nice and accommodation is pleasant. We even switch the room since you'll have much better view from back side of hotel. Food is excellent, great choice of meals. If you decide to explore the area - choose hiking or walking to the hills around. Laško as a town is not much to see, but I would recommend pizzeria nearby, beside the bridge, across the station. All in all - great spot for a short break.;Hotel Zdravilisce Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceHotelZdravilisceLasko;Zdraviliska cesta 4, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1598636;15.2323511
Weekend stay in Laško;4;3.05.2013;Slovenia is one of my favorite countries for holidays and travelling, therefore it was not hard to decision where to go for three day holiday. We booked the stay in hotel Zdravilisce Lasko, which is part of the Thermana wellness complex together with new built hotel Wellness Park. In many reviews you can read that the facility is outdated. There was no problem with that. We had comfort room with river view, big enough to host family with two small children. Half board in the hotel was pleasant with reasonable choice of meals and extras. The stuff friendly and smiling at our kids. We visited swimming pools in both parts, Zdravilisce swimming pools are more for swimming, Wellness Park on the contrary aimed at kids and fun (water slide, artificial waves...), you can swim outside in both parts, which was very pleasant on this spring day. We enjoyed also sipping of local thermal water in the room with the fountain and bust of emperor Franz Joseph I. (the spa was named after him back in the day). Walks through nearby park into the town of Lasko were very pleasant and relaxing - we really enjoyed the sunshine after looong winter. People looking for more fancy and modern will probably head to Wellness Park, but we enjoyed our stay in this traditional hotel as well. PS: first night (only) we heard some strange and loud sounds of running water, did not find out the source of this.;Hotel Zdravilisce Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceHotelZdravilisceLasko;Zdraviliska cesta 4, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1598636;15.2323511
If you love Spa/sauna/steam room facilities, This is your Utopia!;4;10.02.2012;I was here for a week in the summer of 2011 and am coming back this year,This hotel is excellent in my opinion for a couple or for a group of friends who want to relax and above all get away from the world,getting to Lasko is next to impossible if you dont drive or dont have a car.it is a very sweet quiet place slap bang in the middle of a valley and I cant think of somewhere more romantic for a couple that love watersports,the outdoors,swimming,spa treatments,sauna and steam fun in general,remember of course like anywhere else on the continent it is nude in the saunas only so if squeamish stay in the main pool. there are three pools in all,it really is a swimmers paradise and if the modern hotel is not enough just out the door a hundred yards is a wellness centre for older people and one of the best turkish saunas i have ever enjoyed,hot? this thing was molten and you get a selection of honey,sugar,salt,you name it you can rub it into your body in a 100 degree sauna,then pop into the steam room and back into the turkish sauna.then take the ice cold plunge into freezing water,then cold shower,back into the pool for a swim then back into the sauna and steam and sit with beautiful nude german ladies,life really didnt get better than that for me in the summer of 2009!ok the rooms......................Its a cheap shot but they are quiet Stalinesque by the sheer size of the coridors and the amount of rooms,have you seen the Shining? well this place really reminded me of it,this is not an insult,just the scale of this place,it is huge! there is not much to do in Lasko at night so beware all you party animals,its not that kind of place,its perfect for couples who want to rediscover each other and friends who need to get away from their spouses perhaps and back to the rooms,mine was orange!!! very orange but the room was big and very tidy and an excellent bathroom and really nothing to complain about,also a great gym,really well equipped and with a beautiful view of the river and mountains as you cycle the bike or lift weights,the dinners and hotel food are not great hence i take off 1 point,typical hotel fare BUT if you pay extra for lunch or dinner you get an excellent menu and i got a fantastic steak for very little money,the hotel was a bargain for such a 4 star facility because it is 4 star,you have everything you need in this place,you can even get full medical treatments and check ups and massage and really whatever you want to improve your body.this is the place to go for a cheap and healthy weekend.great value and the Slovenian people are genuinely so friendly and really caring,i cant wait for my trip back this summer!;Hotel Zdravilisce Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceHotelZdravilisceLasko;Zdraviliska cesta 4, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1598636;15.2323511
NOT NICE PLACE;2;31.01.2012;Wellnes center-COMPLEX has few hotels , I stayed in an older hotel and it was terrible,. Very expencive, not good service, not nice breakfast and staff not helpfull. Would'n recomend it. When you book a room make sure that it is in new hotel which was nice place. Even we were hotel guest for 2 days they've charged us 5 euros per a day for parking on the hotel paking place.;Hotel Zdravilisce Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceHotelZdravilisceLasko;Zdraviliska cesta 4, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1598636;15.2323511
Mixed feelings ;3;28.05.2017;We came to this place as 4 girlfriends for span/wellness few days break. We arrived very late at night and it was difficult to find it. Parking under hotel very crowded and difficult to understand their parking system. Rooms very tired and toilets really smells, not just in room but also in spa/swimming pool area. Waiter in bar on 7th floor very rude and rest of them not very helpful either. The most expensive massage I had was not what it says on leaflet and what I was expecting. They offered me discount but on end added to my friends bill and not main. Breakfast was great! Lots of choices and you can sit on sunny terrace. The highlight of our stay was when manager came to our table on first day and offered us excursion and information about Rimske Therme. Despite all negative things we faced we would still like to come back.;Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026

Between average and good;3;9.04.2017;We had a room on the third floor in Zdraviliski Dvor, the most inexpensive part of the hotel. The room was a disappointment and did not meet four star hotel standards as the amenities were poor, size of room was very small, sounds from corridor were bothering us, and it was not possible to watch movies on the big screen through your laptop. Hence only three stars instead of four. However, we still enjoyed our stay as the location was very beautiful and the pool section was very nice and sauna world was also ok (not as great as in some other hotels in the region, but still ok). Breakfast was one of the best I have had in the region, but other meals in the buffet restaurant were not that tasty. Service at check-in and check-out was good, but other times only average.;Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026

Unmet expectation;3;21.03.2017;We stayed in Sofija dvor, a part of the hotel which is fine, room was large but dull all in beige colors and purely equipped. Bathroom very big and very green, clean apart from trace of red nail polish left by maid on the door and bath tub! The pool area is clean though the pools are not very big. Saunas are good. Nothing to do there in the evening, outside area not alight so could not take a walk. The staff is merely doing their jobs and are not particularly kind and helpful. We stayed for 2 days and that was more than enough. Olimia terme (Slovenia too) so much better!;Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026
Relaxing experience;4;20.03.2017;Rooms:We stayed in hotel Rimski dvor from 17th until 19th of march 2017 in a standard room. First impression was great: large modern room with an amazing looking bathroom. Minimalistic decoration. Bathrobes were neatly folded on the bed and there was also a set of shampoos, body milk, lotion etc. for each of us on the sink in the bathroom. Mini bar had a nice choice of different beverages (beer, coke, wine, champagne, peanuts, ...). Room view was bad (we could only see nearby trees), however that was fault of ours because we were late with reservation. One very negative aspect of room design is sound isolation in the bathroom. It is non existent. You can hear absolutely everything the other person is doing in there and i really mean EVERYTHING. I know this might not be a problem for everyone, however it will be a problem for some people.4.5/5Food:Breakfast was delicious. There was a truly vast choice of healthy, semi-healthy and unhealthy foods (sausages, waffles, eggs, cheese, fruit, vegetables, different delicious jams, different types of bread, toasts etc.). I can't even remember it all because there were so many choices available. You could also order an omelette and it was prepared instantly. It was truly delicious and the cook (a younger girl) was really nice and kind. It seemed that she truly enjoyed making it. In my opinion a perfect breakfast has to be enjoyed with a glass of a delicious orange juice or coffee. Apple and orange juice were delicious but my girlfriend (caffeinee addict) complained that coffee was actually pretty bad. Breakfast hours are from 8-11am so that's also great for us non-morning people.Dinner was also good. There were many different options and everything i had was very tasty. Nothing tasted bad, however it's the desserts that really stand out - sooo many available options (cakes, puddings, ice cream, fruit etc.). On a negative side - I don't mind paying for wine, but really think that a glass of water (free of charge) wouldn't be too much to ask in a 4* hotel. 5/5Pools and sauna:Pools look amazing (as you can see in the pictures). There is one pool inside and one outside - they are connected, there are also quite many whirpools available on the upper floor. Ancient roman ambient is truly gorgeous. Water in the pool is perhaps a little bit too cold though. There are 4 different saunas (finish, turkish, roman and infra red sauna), a jacuzzi and a cold pool available in the sauna area. It's a shame that sauna area is not available free of charge for guests of the hotel.4/5Staff and hospitality:Staff was generally ok. They weren't smiling a lot. It just kinda seemed as if they are overworked, tired and underpaid. The girl making the omelette was a positive exception though. In general the staff was just OK. Not rude or anything, but not too friendly either. In this hotel you won't hear ''hello, welcome, good morning, good evening'' a lot, it will happen occasionally though. Cleaning lady was also a positive exception.3.5/5.We had a really nice relaxing getaway and will probably return at some point. I would recommend this hotel to younger and older couples who want to experience a nice and a relaxing weekend in a modern, quiet spa resort. I would not recommend it to families with children that are older than 8-9 years old because they might get bored quickly.;Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026
Lost in a labirint;3;16.03.2017;Why is a hotel good, why do we feel ourselves home in a hotel? This is a mystery. There might be lots of reasons. We arrive, the receptionist saying “hello, you are welcome”, “how are you? It is nice that you arrived”. After the arrival, you get your room. You feel at home. You go to the restaurant, you get some food.Everything is ok, you arrived, you will become a part of the environment and the hotel. The receptionist smile on you every time you passing by.Well this hotel, Hotel Rimske Terme is different. The receptionist in this hotel is not saying hello, not says that you are welcome. There is a distant smile on his face, the smile is just a promise. I could smile, I could be friendly but I cannot, I will not. That is not a smile we get from him.We were driving 400 km to get here, into this beautiful Hotel. This four stars (who has given the stars?) hotel looks like a castle. The castle is shining on a hill. The building looks proud and rich from outside. The landscape is eye catching. We enjoy the nicest minutes of March. But when you arrive into the building your experiences get different. The garage is crowded, there is not kept the elementary traffic rules by the parking. You have to back several times to find a proper parking place. In the inclined garage backing it is not easy.The receptionist gave us the keys, but nothing said. Neither that you are welcome, here is the restaurant, here is the bath, nor you’ll find this here that over there. Practically he didn’t say anything. We find our room in the labyrinth. (There are 10 floors, our room is on the tenth floor, the restaurant is on the 6th flor the bath on the 4th floor) If you didn’t get information you can be lost.There are missing the pictures from the walls in this hotel, there are some but mostly there are ancient Latin phrases on the walls instead of pictures. We might learn, we might admire the wisdom of the ancient times. Does the management know what are the meanings of these Roman phrases? What is the message of this: Da locum melioribus? This is the phrase of our room. Means that this is a bad room and the better rooms belong to the reach people? You had better to leave, you had better to get room for others? Or what? I would be glad if anyone could explain what is the message of the Hotel for us?Our room is big and dark, the bathroom is nice (green tile, really nice) but the window is small. When I ask the receptionist to provide us a lighter room, he said that we’d had to pay 30 EUR additionally. They showing us another room with the same size window, the room is as dark as our present one. We remain - don’t move-, in the “Da locum..’ room and felt that we were lost again.It seems that in this Hotel everybody is lost. In the restaurant (the fish-scale left on the fish) one waiter is lovely, the another is rude. The staff is also lost. No smile, not saying hello. Dobar dan is said approximately by just on third of the staff. When a hotel staff says Hello, we get surprised. What is this, is he/she lost? The majority of the staff doesn’t care for guests at all. The café near by the reception is also a mystery. The waiters coming to ask what we want just after long waiting period. There is a TV screen, I guess that the staff watching rather TV, than serving the guests. Finally, we get our coffee. We look around. How looks like this coffee? In the centre, there are two big white statues. These are some kind of baroque illustration, but they are totally in contrast with minimal art of the hotel. I have never ever seen so ugly statues as these before. Why are they here? The coffee has not get a corridor to the elevator from the hotel, but there Is not road among the tables. We walk unhandily among the desk and chairs. The staff is lost. We are fare from cities. The staff have to get a long trip to get here. They may also be lost.I go the fitness room. Crazily laud music, you man are over there, probably not hotel guests. No staff, nobody say hello. This might be even dangerous. We are lost in the labyrinth. Where are we? In a hotel, or somewhere else? I think that the answer comes from the past. This hotel was a Wehrmacht place in the second world war, and in the Yugoslavian time it was working as a military hotel or hospital, some kind of sanatorium, I don’t know.I have to add to the surreal reality of the Hotel that there are two restaurants. One of them must be for the half-service launch and breakfast guests. This restaurant has a very modest style, just like a Trade -Union resort (not a four stars’ hotel restaurant) and another one on the seventh floor. The seventh-floor restaurant is fancy and nice. It is nearly empty.There is a mysterious lounge in the hotel. There must be a very long event in this lounge, because it takes 3-5 days. It is written since our arrival a board: Lounge bar reserved for private function.This a labyrinth. It has some bouquet, but this bouquet deserves maximum 3 starsI have to add that the park around is beautiful. Must be seen. The therme is an other story. I write critic about next time.;Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026

From the minute we arrived the experience was amazing. The hotel is modern mixed with old infrastructure and to me it looks amazing.

Most for your money;5;18.02.2017;I've been in this same hotel for the third time now visiting the Rimske Toplice for vacation. The hotel has very good food, much of local cusine with wholefoods from local farmers, a lot of different dishes in the menu for every taste. There is nice staff, eager to help and please and a lovely and celan wellness - pools and sauna. I like it is a quite hotel, so it is the best place to stay. Even with more guests, it never gets too crowded.

The best resort in Slovenia!;5;7.02.2017;We've stayed at Rimske Terme twice (summer of 2014 and again in 2016), and it's a magnificent and amazing place to stay. We've been to Slovenia 15-20 times since 1999, and Rimske Terme is in a league of its own. The wellness and spa area is simply amazing - beautiful and elegant in every detail and to be found in the most serene setting with beautiful hills and forests all around. The service is good, the rooms are very nice (especially those with a view), and the restaurant serves decent food.

Pleasant spa getaway;4;16.01.2017;We spent 2 days for a short spa break here in January. The room we rented was a suite with in room jacuzzi. The room itself was very spacious and nice, the bathroom was modern and the jacuzzi area was very nice as well. The breakfast at the hotel was self-service (buffet), the selection was good and the food was freshly prepared. They had an omelette making station and waffles making stations where these dishes were prepared for you directly. The dinner was also ok, perhaps could be a bit better selection. The evening of our stay they also had some issues with the staff and the workload for waiters on duty was clearly too much- we finished our dinner before we received our drinks (however, not holding this against anyone since it can happen that someone falls out of duty in the last moment due to illness...). The pool area is nice, while the food in the pool bar is not very good- we ordered some burgers and they were swimming in fat (literally), we couldn't eat them and ordered toast instead (which was ok). The cakes in the bar are good and they have a nice selection. The only thing which bothered me: there is a nespresso machine in the room and you can make yourself coffee (it costs some 1.5eur or so). There was supposed to be milk in the minibar but there was none in our room. We asked at the reception if we could get some and they said no problem, but it never arrived. It is a small thing but when you pay almost 200 eur per room/night, you expect the service to be excellent. I would recommend this hotel for a nice quiet spa get-away, although I am not sure how reachable it is without a car.;Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026
Great weekend getaway (twice)!;5;9.01.2017;I visited Rimske terme first in October 2016 and I just had to come back in December 2016. This place is truly great. A 200€ deal for a weekend getaway with unlimited pool entrance, great saunas, fitness, great self-service food and very friendly staff. The waiters in the restaurants are clearly overworked and tired but we still got all our drinks in time and we got served well. On the other hand the staff at the Wellness centre and the pool work all day long and they still manage to be very helpful and smiling. What was great for me is that even though there were a lot of people there the place didn't seem crowded.

Lovely short relaxation ½weekend½;4;20.12.2016;We stayed at the Zdraviliški dvor, the room was lovely and really clean. We hadn´t had a view, but that did not bother us at all since walking around the hotel there is a view of Rimske Toplice town all the times. Small complaints we would have with staff. The cleaning staff in the morning did not care to take the plates and dirty dishes away. Also at the arival we asked for bathing robes, which should have been sent to our room, but didnt came till the end of our staying, so we didnt care to ask them again. Overall, the bathing area is very nice, peacefull, there were not a lot of children during our stay. Also the saunas are nice, not crowded in December, clean. We had breakfast and dinner, both was nice, but I loved the breakfast more. Loads to choose from, fresh, warm waffles, lovely staff.

Good relaxation, mediocre personel;3;21.11.2016;I stayed for 2 nights, in the hotel Rimski dvor. The room is modern and nicely outfitted. I was not pleased as the room was made sloppy and the towels were not changed during my stay. The buffet - restaurant offers good choice of meals (for breakfast and dinner), but the more expensive restaurant A'la carte restaurant Sofia was a big disappointment. I waited for the main course 45 minutes, the taste was plain and the price was exaggerated. The swimming pools are great, but it would be nice if there were separate pool areas for children, as I went there for relaxation and not listening to children crying. The pool massages are weak and could be turned on more often. The staff was friendly, but the front desk offered little information on arrival.;Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026

Relaxing location, disappointing service;4;1.11.2016;We spent 4 nights (so 5 days) there. We loved the location - the hotel and it's surroundings. It is absolutely beautiful. Unfortunately, we had disturbing issues with our room. The contact for electricity kept disconnecting, so our lights would go out at any time (sometimes it would turn itself back on, sometimes not). Moreover, the shower cabin leaked so we were left with a big puddle on the floor after showering (had to use towels to soak it up). When we told the receptionist about the problems they said they'd get it checked out and that they would order extra towels (for the leak), but we didn't hear back. Most of the staff in the reception were cold, not offering much information. We told them about the problems at checkout, when a different - kinder - staff memeber apologised and took notes. I'm glad that the pool area is wonderful - we enjoyed it lots. I loved how some areas have heated floors where you can lie on mats. And the pool staff was extremely kind. :) The same can be said for the restaurant staff and the place itself. Wonderful, clean, lots of different food, delicious.;Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026
Nice place with great landscape;4;1.11.2016;This was my second time there and it felt nice. Hotel is surrounded with a beautiful landscape, very nice woods and hills. Pools are nice, water is right temperature, staff is very nice, rooms are spacious, breakfast was good, food in restaurant was good. Saunas are nice. My only comment will go towards maintanace. I was there twice in the span of three years and there are visible signs of use and wear. Nothing much, probably most of the people will not notice, but it would be a shame that such a nice place becomes worn.;Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026

Full of energy!;5;13.09.2016;When you need a break, a real break plus you want something different and relaxing. Best time is winter when is snowing but you can't be wrong for the rest of the year. Peacefull place, great termal water, perfect to drink coffee in the morning on the terrace of the hotel. Great burgers by the pool, try LASKO dark beer, food in the restaurant is also good, beds are superb. X trail track is awesome by the hotel , distance 1500m.

Review regarding pedicure;2;11.09.2016;I went there to get a pedicure and was really not satisfied with it.I had many pedicures done before and this one was not that good for the amount they charge!

Autumn visit to Rimske Terme;4;5.09.2016;The hotel was renovated, nice, pools are great, the service also. Dogs are allowed in one wing with surcharge. Half board was great, with lots of choices and the food was very tasty. Weekend live music. Around the hotel is a beautiful nature to walk and park with redwoods.

Our stay at Rimske Terme - Aug 2016;3;1.09.2016;We are travelling through Europe as part of our extended honeymoon and decided to stay for 3 nights at Rimske Terme to have a romantic break away from all the summer crowds and tourism. The accommodation was nice and the facilities were modern and well maintained. The accommodation cost $100 euros per night for a standard room which was fair. Not really the hotels fault but FYI: As we are English only speaking people, the majority of complex staff did not speak any English, so it made for an interesting time trying to communicate. A few points to note: 1. We found a few of the staff members around the bars and restaurants quite unwelcoming and boarder line arrogant in their approach to customer service.. I'm not sure if this was because we could not speak Slovenian or what? 2. The gym shuts down for 4 hours though the day so you cannot access.. This was an inconvenience especially when you are paying to use the facilities. 3. The spa treatments were quite expensive for what you received.. A basic couples package a short massage and a pedicure came to approximately $250 euro.4. Its advertising is based around guests looking around the age of 20 - 40.. This was misleading as the estimated average age whist we were there was more like 50 - 60. This isn't any real issue for us but it is worth noting if you are looking here.To finish on a good note the staff at reception were amazing.. They arranged pickup and drop off to train stations which went above and beyond. Overall a mixed bag when you compare this experience with what you get when staying in spa resorts within the South Pacific like in Fiji.;Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026
Waste of money;1;14.08.2016;It was a bitter dissapointment!!Advertised as luxurious hotel with dinning and welness experience it was everything else but that!

Dinner is equally respectful of different tastes and it offers a wide choice of fish and meat dishes and any kind of raw and cooked vegetables and last but not least an accurate selection of cakes and pastries. Rooms are extra large. I can't imagine how large suites are!!!!

Short Exit from Daily Routine;5;29.06.2016;For my birthday my wife booked two night stand in Rimski dvor Hotel. Was our first time, before arriving I admit, did not expect anything special. But how wrong I was. Very classy, hotel with soul, hotel with theme, on every wall a roman saying. Amazing cousine, very clean room. Spa renovated from the old roman times. My comment was Romans got lost there and stayed. Really can't find anything against this place.

Rrlaxing week end;3;20.03.2016;"We booked this place with a short notice (3 days in advance). We were given the top floor room in \ Sofijin Dvor\"". Rom was clean and OK; what we missed was a large bed and not two next to each other; the TV was pretty small and mounted low; what made pretty much impossible to watch it from bed. Otherwise the room was clean. Food in the restaurant on 6th floor was always served cold, no matter what time you get in; you get it cold. The 2nd day we took \""a la carte\"" dinnner and that was OK. Fitness is open in the morning; and than after 16:00; and yet pretty badly crowded from external users; what makes your way out to get the exercises done pretty much difficult or either impossible. The machines control panels are in German only, so figure it out, hence there is no one to assist you.The kids play room looks nicely, but in spite of all the bright places with many winfows in the hotel is it placed in inner dark part.Staff is friendly and pollite; service is in general pretty slow.I would say this is not a place for families, people with higher standards and older people who moves arround with difficulties; hence the place is pretty spreaded here and there.Personaly I would prefer not to call back here again.""";Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026

WORTH VISITING AGAIN !!!;4;28.02.2016;"The hotel complex is situated in a quiet part of Rimske toplice, surrounded by woods.It consists of three hotels united in one and a villa with three apartments. Around the hotel and in the area you can find lot of hiking and biking trails allowing you to have peaceful and active break from everyday life.According to photos of other travelers on this website, standard rooms look spacious and modern, but simple and maybe not so cozy decorated, that's why we decided to ask for a suite.We have got a suit in the \Sofijin dvor Hotel\"", on the 10th floor, with a great view of the surroundings and mountains. The suit is spacious and comfortable with a separate living-room and a separate bedroom, bathroom and a corridor: the only downside is the lack of personality and warmth in modern interior design of the suit. For example, floor and table lamps in the living-room, or a small details could make a huge difference and make you feel more cozy. Otherwise, the suit is perfect. There are two flat TVs and a mini-bar, small safety deposit box, air-condition system, hairdryer.The suit was spotlessly clean, there were slippers, bathrobes and towels you can use when going to the pool or wellness, and free toiletries as well.WiFi worked perfectly. Garage is free for hotel guests.Food served at dinner and breakfast was very good and tasteful, with a great varieties for everyone.The hotel staff is friendly and helpful.Pool area: only one pool with inside and outside part, not for children, one jacuzzi inside and two outside, sunbeds and separate places to have rest around the pool. Inside is a pretty humid. The water temperature was perfect. The pool area could be a little bit crowded during weekends because it is used not only by hotel guests, but by daily guest as well. There is a wellness as well, but we didn't try any of offered products (perhaps next time).There are two cafes and an a la carte restaurant as well - we didn't try any of those.

My review of SAUNA WORLD;3;13.02.2016;"Me and my boyfriend visited sauna section in Rimske Toplice. It was not bad, but also not great. While overall experience was quite good, there were all this little things that can easily diminish the experience:- there was only one receptionist at the front desk on Friday afternoon and a lot of guests vaiting in line but there were stations for 3 receptionists, 2 of them deserted- the finnish and turkish saunas were too hot- there were signs on 2 showers, stating \out of order\"" and it looked like they were out of business for quite some time. one of it was covered by a broken door and a flowerpot (ficus?)- the cleaning lady made 2 walk-throughs with linen trolley as we(the guests) weren't there- the lifeguards seemed distant and started to shut down the sauna world 20 minutes before closing, pairing up the pool chairs and switching down the resting areas, turning up the lights and removing refreshments. it was cutting into our payed 4-hour stay and it was utterly impolite!- there was no ice in the ice bucket- some locker rooms were out of order, there were stains on the floor and a ceiling tile was missing+ nice showers (the existing ones)+ hot tub on the terrace+ polite receptionist""";Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026
Pleasant stay;4;9.02.2016;I have spent 4 nights during January 2016 in Hotel Rimski Dvor. It was all as I have expected. Clean room, pool and hotel area. There was variety of choices for breakfast and dinner. I only have smell chlorine more than it shoul be and after wirst swim got some red spots on whole body. I never had it before so maybe there was too much of some supstance. The outdoor pool is amasing. It was -8'C and I was outside in the water. That is something to remember.We took massage and the ladies did a great job.I have mostly good critics. Maybe the type of water is just not adequate for me. The skin becomes very dry and toned but for some people that is a plus.So worthy to visit and enjoy the beauty of water and nature.;Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026
beautifull and realxing experience;5;7.02.2016;I stayed at the hotel Rimski dvor for 2 nights. The room was really nice, tidy and well furnished.I enjoyed breakfast more than dinner. You can choose from freshly made omlette, waffles, freshly baked bread, yoghurts, pastry, spreads and the list goes on and on. I wish there were more vegeterian options for dinner though.

Roman and almost mystique experience in the middle of beautiful nature;5;7.02.2016;Me and my partner have chosen Rimske Terme for a romantic getaway for the second time in a row this year. When someone thinks the experience cannot be upgraded from the first time experience, this is not the case with Rimske Terme. We were staying in Rimski dvor, suite Melissa, spacious and extremely comfortable suite with private sauna. All clean and neat and of course, as a history enthusiast, I appreciated latin quotes all over the place. Spa with its calmness and image is one of a kind in Slovenia and I dare say in this region.

Very satisfied;4;4.02.2016;This is our second visit to Rimske terme.Hotel is very clean and last time me and my girlfriend stayed we got very big room.In fact too big for my taste.There is a feeling that the space in room could be better used.Pools are nice and clean and we like that pools are not standard look like most of the other's wellnes and spa's.It brings the spirit of old Rome.There are few or none children which is good for us as we dont want to hear and see children screaming and running around so if you are looking for the family package probably this place is not for you.Sauna is ok,especially i love turkish as is really relaxing.Only thing that bothers me is that you have to sit inside but naked which in my opinion is not so hygenic.But it is probably cultural thing as in my country people dont have that practice.Restorant has wide selection and i like that is buffet type as you can take a litlle bit of everything.Cakes are really excellent!!Surounding is beautifull and quietOverall a very pleasent and nice stay.Will come back for sure.;Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026

Great winter vacation in slow motion :);5;7.01.2016;Stayed for 3 nights during holidays in December and was great period for relaxing in green environment, excellent rooms and good spa center. Not too crowded hotel and pool. Interior/pool is designed in Roman style and was great feeling to swim in 32ÿC inside and 35ÿC outside, although the critic goes to the massage jets as some of them were not working so it was always crowd around those ones which were working. It was great value for money as we booked some special offer. It would be great to have some additional facilities and activities except zumba, spa center and one evening bar with poor wine offer.

Good wellness but canteen food;3;5.01.2016;"Stayed in Rimske terme for a few days between Christmas and New Year. As wellness and accomodation are worth of the money I cannot say this for the food offer and quality of the dinner. Dinners were really at the canteen level (have to stress that at the same time breakfasts were good classic and diverse) with limited meat and vegetable offer (almost all salad was lettuce served in several bowls as to create an impression of diversity?), cold cuts were very basic (not even a slice of prosciutto e.g. \kraški pršut\"" is very famous slovenian product and should be essential part of the cold cuts), it also looked like some dishes were made of the ingrediants left from previous meals. Organisation of the dinner time was inadequate i.e. only two hours for all guests, so the dinner enviroment was too crowdy and noisy. Personnel was inattentive. Location is nice in the middle of the nature with some great views. Regardless location, spa and bath, the food offer is not worth of 4 stars hotel and at full capacity hotel services should be better organised (to provide guests some \""space\"" at least during the meals).""";Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026
Not really worth it...;3;18.12.2015;Me and my husband came back, because we had a great time a year ago, when we first visited. But unfortunately it looked as though they are starting to cut costs at the expense of the guests. Overall it is still quite clean and the staf is really friendly, but I was so dissapointed when it came to food that I give it only an average review. I like self service, because I can take a little bit of everything, but there was almost nothing that appealed to me from all the foods on display. The soup and sauces were totally artificial, meat burned, some meats looked as though they were left from breakfast, and the desserts all tasted the same. Tasteless. Much of the food is also cold, when it should be warm. The Italians at the next table were constantly complaining about the food as well. When the dinner was not even finished, they were setting up breakfast cereals and other foods for the next day, so the food was out for the whole night. Some salami also looked as though it has been there since the night before. I am not that picky, but I left hungry everytime. The cleaning lady knocks before 9 in the morning, which is really too early. Otherwise I liked their sauna area and the historic baths part, although the saunas are too cold for my taste. The pool is pretty basic, but clean. There are some whirlpool baths, which never have bubbles. Oh, and there is no wi-fi or even a phone signal in the pool area, no wi-fi in the restaurant, but in the room it works ok. In my oppinion, it is not worth 4 stars, even though the potential is there.;Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026

No need to go out and about.We have been here for a business training gathering.Finding the hotel for the first time or navigating around it, can be a bit of a challenge as also other colleagues found it.Most of us came in a foggy or night weather and got lost, because of the confusing signs one sees if coming from highway through Celje to the hotel. Mind that the first sign is only for daily guests parking. The hotel access is another (200m?) further on.It is a complex of (3) connected hotels and if you drive straight in the underground garage, mind the signs or you will find yourself unintentionally exploring it. Just take the elevator to the 7th floor - lobby. Elevators, passageways, hallways are not intuitive a lot of writings/quotes on walls can make you miss the navigation signs. The room was quite nice, but without any wow factors. For a wellness hotel I missed a weighing scale in it and maybe a fresh fruit delivery. I got accustomed to this in other hotels of this type. I was in a double bed room and although it should be the smallest, it was quite big.The restaurant offers a good variety and quality dishes. The staff is nice and unobtrusively catering the guests. One thing to the waiters, if they are reading this. If one asks for beer, this doesn't automatically mean Lasko, although the brewery is close. We liked the speed of service, but being an international group we wouldn't mind an additional question on the choice.Although the hotel's strength is wellness and spa, unfortunately due to the tight schedule I did not have time to use them. Furthermore, as it is also a problem with a lot of other Slovenian hotels wanting to be business and congress friendly the operating times from 8 on, make it impossible for a busy person to go for a swim before breakfast, etc. Evening fitness and dinner service misalign as well.Nevertheless since overall my stay was quite a pleasant one, I am sure to return and explore the hotel wellness. Of course staying for at least two nights and without business activities. Just plain pleasure.The parent in me must mention to other travelers that there is also a kids' playroom and outdoor playground.;Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026

FANTASTIC !;5;1.12.2015;We spent 4 faboluos days at fantastic superior suite with jacuzzi.

Very very nice;5;27.11.2015;We spend four days in this magnificent resort and I must say, is definitely on our list. We had accommodation in spacious room in Zdravilski dvor. The room is nice decorated with blue mosaics and drawings, and beds are very comfy. Inside pool is quite large, but one of best bits are thoose whirlpool and hot-tubs out front. Its great to take a swim in a warm pool on a cold winter day.

Perfect;5;20.11.2015;The place is amazing. We were there 4 nights/5 days and everything was perfect. We stayed in Zdravilski dvor and the room was nice, big and comfortable. The pools and the saunas are amezing, and also the relaxing zones. We enjoyed to walk on the hiking tralis near the hotel with our dog. The food was very good and the wine also, especially in the a la cart restorant in Sofija. Everything is perfect, and the stuff is very good and kind.

Pardise in the woods;5;10.11.2015;Even though we usualy go to terme in Croatia this time We decided for a relax weekend in Rimske terme. Since there was 6 of us, 4 adults and 3 small childern we decided that in Vila Sisi we will have more privacy and we want disturb outher people in the hotel.This was best decision ever!!!!! Villa is located just few metars from the reception, since it was fall, the path leading to Vila was coverd with fallinf leafs that made it even more charming.The apartment it self is sttuning...in size as well sa in the amentities it offers. The glas Windows cover 80% of the interiour and give a wonderful view of the wood that you can enjoy directly from your bed. Apartment was perfectly cleand and tidy we really felt like home.Reception stuf is also Worth mentioning, they are very friendly and wellcoming.

Very good!;5;7.11.2015;Hotel is very modern but still traditional, build like in Roman times. We liked the pool very much - it is very impressive. Check in was fast and easy. Room very comfortable, well firnished and clean. You must visit saunas - they are really nice and we spent a nice time there. Breakfast is delicious with wide selection of food. Staff very friendly. Guests are mostly Young, with no kids which is good (usualy in there you have a lot of old people and kids).We will visit this hotel again.;Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026
Great location, nice spa, pleasant staff, but poor maintenance;3;9.10.2015;We booked a standard room because it looked good on the webpage but that was a mistake. The room was quite small and a bit run down (paint peeling from the wall, shabby carpet, only Slovenian TV channels), shower doors in the bathroom were a bit twisted so didn't close very well, 24/24 humming noise from outside machinery required ear plugs to sleep with open window. The park is beautiful with old growth trees, views must be splendid on sunny days (it rained for four days in a row during our stay).Breakfast spread was plentiful and had wide selection of cold cuts, cheeses, bread, rolls, egg dishes, veggies and more. Coffee was horrible, we thought (but then we're used to real espresso) although Germans, Austrians, Russians and Slovenians seemed to like it.We had supper at the a la carte restaurant on the 7th floor, entrée was delicious, main courses a bit bland, and my dessert was unusual but very nice. The waiter recommended a special red wine (apparently not available in stores) which was absolutely incredible, the best red I've had in Slovenia. Service was expeditious.If you plan to have a massage, ask for Melita - according to my wife, she's the best masseuse she's ever had. My massage was probably ok - I slept through most of it. The manicure/pedicure/beauty care services were average according to my wife. My manicure and pedicure were indeed not of the same standard as back home.The sauna space is top of the line, four different types of sauna, lots of showers, cold water tub, relaxation room, I really loved it. Didn't try the pools because of the crowd but they looked fine. The gym has fairly old equipment, fine for pumping iron but the treadmills need servicing. Main drawback: you can't open any windows, there's no fresh air, and when a group a young musclemen tries to outsweat each other, the oxygen level drops quickly while the carbon monoxide level, together with the olfactory inconvenience, can quickly become a disincentive to going through your routine program.I believe all of these minor flaws could be fixed by capable management and turn this place into a really enjoyable spa.;Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026
Fairy tale in the mountains;5;7.10.2015;Fantastic place where we enjoyed fantastic SPA facilities, amazing thermal swimming pool and a fairy tale view from the restaurant and swimming pool.

Disappointed;3;17.09.2015;We stayed at the hotel Rimske terme - despite the late arrival (at 17h), the room was not ready yet. The room are nice, but short bed, TV was not working.The food is buffet - offer sufficient category 3 * or less. The average selection of meals, every day the same taste all the dishes (but not fussy). The staff at the restaurant was slow and confusing.Swimming in the spa - spa is much smaller than you think for photos online, too few sun loungers, hygiene is not exactly the best (fungi).In any case, they do not deserve Category 4 *.;Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026
Nice hotel, bad management;3;7.09.2015;"Hi guys. Me and my family spent this weekend at this hotel. I have to say it's very big, there are 3 hotels: zdraviliški, sofijin dvor and rimski hotel. We stayed at Rimski. As I said it is huuuuge and beautiful. We stayed in suites so I don't know how the standard rooms are. Ours were big, cozy and very nice. What we immediately noticed was that it was cold inside, through the whole complex. It felt like it was 20 degrees. We called the reception and the lady there told as she was gonna raise the temperature in our room. The next day we went to ask again because we still felt cold and she said the highest temp in the room is 25degrees, which I think is silly but ok. The point was there is no way our room was at 25. To sum up, every room, every corridor, even the wellness was cold to us.Food. We did not like it. In such a beautiful hotel we expected the food to be tasteful, but.. Nope.The last thing. Everyone that worked there was nice, except a girl at the reception. I didn't catch her name but she was blonde and wore glassess. She really seemed to hate working there.We were really dissapointed for the bad management of it all - I hope they change some things cause it could be the best hotel in Slovenia if they did.That's all folks ;))";Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026
Very relaxing.;4;2.09.2015;The structure is quite new, well presented and kept. It is very pleasant but unfortunately my expectation on service were not met, it was just average especially in the spa where the treatments were always shorter by 30 minutes, three times out of three.

Villa Sisi at Rimske Terme;5;6.08.2015;We booked the small apartment at Villa Sisi. It was very comfortable and elegantly equipped. A minute walk from the main bulidings, surrounded by the beauty and peace of the forest. It is a great place to relax after the wondrful breakfest at the hotel or a visit to the spa and the pools.Everything was reasonably priced , except for the dinner that was a disapointment (We did not try the hotel a la carte resturant Sofia).;Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026
Wonderful Rooms and Restaurant, good pool/spa;4;29.07.2015;This is a hotel in a very beautiful area, with very beautiful rooms (even with wooden jacuzzi), great bed and linens. The hotel interior design is amazing, great latin sentences all around, inspiring and relaxing us. Very new rooms and modern decoration, beautiful building. Beautiful view from the bedroom and corridors, great modern TV and options of entertainment. Very relaxing area.The dining offers 2 options: a la carte or buffet, the first one is a little pricey but very tasty. Second one I didn't try, only breakfasts. Very good variety and quality of food for breakfast too.The pool are looks like antic Rome baths, and is very pretty and sleek, but the pools are kinda small. The spa is very good, has lots of options, I would recommend the romantic bath for 2, is very relaxing and lasts almost 1 hour if I remember well.The staff is very courteous and speak good English. The only down of this hotel was the advertising and the pricing, it was a little pricey and the ads and packages they have as offering in their site can be kinda confusing (read the small letters before booking). Also the rooms could have better sound isolation.Great stay and very comfy/relaxing with new rooms, great shower in bathroom and modern decoration.;Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026
Perfect for a peaceful and relaxing weekend retreat;5;24.07.2015;This was my fourth stay in this hotel, my second in the Rimski Dvor. I love all three “parts”, Zdraviliški Dvor, Sofijin Dvor and Rimski Dvor, though the latter is my favorite. The staff is friendly, especially the waiters at dinner, the rooms are big (the rooms in Rimski d. are by far the largest in the hotel), roomy, and comfortable.The pool is large and “swimmable” if you’re lucky not to share your weekend retreat with families with rambunctious children. The food is good, although a few more selections wouldn’t hurt. Parking is free, so is wi-fi, and the grounds around the hotel offer some good walking opportunities.The location, removed from any major city, is a plus if you want to get away from everything, but if it’s nightlife or sights you seek, you will have to drive.What I love most about this hotel and its location, it’s the energy. I feel comfortable here, and have yet to experience the ennui that sooner or later hits me in other hotels.;Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026

But if you want to enjoy as couple, or organize the congress this place is higly recomended. Cleanliness everywhere, friendly much helpfull and professional stuff. If you could afforded food in a la card resturant (15-25 EUR per meal) is delicous no matter is it fish or meat. Opened and free WI-FI, very romatnic place.Pool is perfectly decoraded in roman style and I spontaneously spoke Latin :). Squaers with lounges alow you perfect privacy. Not too many guests, pool bar and avarage prices (2,5 EUR beer).

Good facilities, not such a family-friendly hotel.;4;5.01.2015;"We stayed at this hotel during the New Year and enjoyed only the swimming pools (which were included in the price we were offered.) The food is also very good and there is so much to chose from. Excellent chefs, we were impressed!Now some tips to work on:a. The package we were offered indicated \access to all thermal pool areas\"" which did NOT include the saunas. We were very disappointed because we did pay a lot of money and thought we would access the sauna with our small son who has bronchitis, but no. This is at an extra cost.b. The New Years package which we paid extra for (our child was charged 30 euro) did not include food for children or anything for children. It included canapes and finger food which kids do not eat. I was about to complain to the manager when one staff member politely asked if we want to give the kids french fries and chicken nuggets, so yes, they made that for the kids at the last minute while we all waited for food and ate the bread which was served at the table.In addition, the New Years celebration included a band which played music for the elderly and was mostly attended mostly by a 60+ crowd. I am disappointed that NOTHING was planned for children as there were at least 15 kids in the room. I saw families leave very early the room because their kids were hungry (we were asked to arrive by 7:30 and food started to arrive, bit by bit, from 9)... People were eating bread which was at the table when we arrived, that's it.The hotel reservation desk should have told us that it was more appropriate to attend the regular dinner (at no extra cost) upstairs and enjoy the DJ music and same food as what we paid extra for...It would have been nice to be honest about it, but the hotel just wanted to charge us extra and they don't really think about our needs/expectations and our two small children who were bored to death and very hungry!In addition, the New Years package included a Surprise Gift. Nothing was given to us. Very unprofessional!So I feel cheated because we were not given everything we were offered and honestly, it looks like it was planned last minute. The staff knew nothing about the New Years celebration until about 5-6 hours before the evening began.In addition, WiFi is very weak (non existent) in some areas, such as the restaurant and the swimming pool.To conclude, I recommend this hotel to the elderly but not to families with small children because apart from the swimming pools, your kids will have nothing to do. And do expect the older folks to approach you at the pool and ask that your kids don't swim noisily (as kids do) or splash around (as kids do) because they were told by the hotel that it is an all adult hotel and they want peace and quiet!There is a very small kids playroom which is where we spent all the evenings.Its sad that such a hotel does not organize a simple 1 or 2 person team to entertain or play with the kids, giving their parents a little rest time or even making it fun for kids to stay there. Also having extra-paid babysitting is an option. So many ideas, but the hotel doesn't have the imagination!Not sure we would come back here as there is another hotel, not far away called Thermana Lasko with indoor pools and activities for kids which seems more appropriate for us, and other families.""";Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026

Great place to relax;4;2.12.2014;Rimske Terme Hotel is a collection of three hotels at one location under the same management that share a common thermal spring resort and spa center. The location of Rimske Terme is beautiful, on a hillside overlooking a river, farmland, forests, and hills and mountains. We stayed at the Hotel Sofijin Dvor in a suite. The room was enormous. One huge living room and separate bedroom. However, the living room was sparse. A couch, two soft chairs, a small coffee table, a small desk, flat panel TV on the wall. Lots of empty space. Almost made you wonder why you would need so much space. A table and tea/coffee service in the room would have been nice to have. The thermal spring swimming pools were very nice with comfortable water temperatures. Massage service in the spa was also good with reasonable prices. The medical facility that can give you evaluations and create wellness programs for you is still evolving with their services. For example, the doctor was only available on Thursdays. There was a sense that although the spa and the medical facility were in the same resort with the same management, they competed against each other. That is something that needs to get addressed by the management. The food for the buffet breakfast, lunch, and dinner were good. Large selection of various type of cuisine to fit your interests and diet preferences. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone seeking a great place to relax, enjoy some pampering, and de-stress.;Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026

Very good choice of spa and wellness facilities.4. Rooms very big and comfortable and also clean.5. The surrounding of the hotel is very nice for relaxation. And now some negative parts of our stay... - There wasn't an opportunity to relax in the pool because the water was not so warm as it was written on the spa reception. (first time when we were here it was much more warm.)- The employees weren't so positive and interested in helping, except one girl that worked in the reception.- For dinner you must pay 15 euros, but still, if you want to drink anything, you must pay extra.- Housekeeping was entering in our room even though we put the sign \do not disturb\"" on the door.""";Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026

Good value for money;4;8.07.2014;It was our second stay in Hotel Sofijin dvor. We travel to Rimske toplice becouse of the spa. The rooms are big and nice decorated with a nice view. Breakfast choise is good, dinner could be better. Sauna area is very nice and the therapis in the saunas are very good. If you stay there you need to go to the massage, is superb one of the best i ever had. Is also nice to go to the old part of spa and take a bath and enjoy the sound of relaxed music played from the lady's dressed in the old Roman custume. I recomend this spa hotel for a short stay.;Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026
Hotel accommodation is OK. SPA - average.;4;8.07.2014;The rooms are clean and modern. The hotel is in a beautiful nature. Around the hotel does not have facilities for entertainment.

A little disappointing;3;19.08.2013;My husband and I recently spent two nights at this hotel, and were a bit disappointed. The hotel design is appealing, the room was massive and the surrounding nature was beautiful, but the hotel seemed to be short on service staff (there was only one guy serving and cleaning up at the bar/cafe, for example). The food was bland, though there was a decent variety of dishes at breakfast and dinner. Definitely DON'T pay the €15 for lunch, as the selection and quality are rather poor. Instead, go to the nearby town of Lasko (an 8-minute drive) for a hike and some pizza or local cuisine.As for the pool and terme, we felt it was a bit small and crowded. We were disappointed that the waters weren't as warm as expected, and there was no real hot tub (just two smaller pools with water jets, but the same temperature as the big pool). It's also frustrating to pay extra for use of the saunas.;Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026

one of the best in Slovenia;5;31.07.2013;Really one of the nicest spa in Slovenia. We were there for a weekend stay at least 4-5 times by now and will be returning - of curse if the prices remain the same with the potential new owner. There are quite a lot of rooms, but even if it is full you have a feeling that you are more or less alone (except breakfast, where might a problem to get coffee at the rush hour). The things I didn't like : if you check out on Sunday morning after the busy weekend, there is a long queue at the front desk (half an hour wait). Cleaning ladies will always check the minibar before you leave and some of them really do not have any feeling how to approach a guest, which might still be in the room. The staff usually does not allow you to use the bathrobe on the last day after the check out. We do use it anyway, as I really do not want to use my personal towels only for a few hours and than have to wash them, as I apparently am staying at the 4* hotel.;Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026
Only for the spa;2;29.07.2013;"With my wife we just visited spa, so this review does NOT include hotels. When arived, we loved the surroundings and the whole complex (hotels ets.), now renovated. It looks fantastic from the outside. The spa is a part of a hotel, and also the whole spa is renovated. In my opinion the restoration did not focus on preserving the look of an ancient (roman) bath place. It has some kind of feel you are in Rome in a public spa some 1 century BC, but it is just a bad illusion. There is a little room for visitors, to relax in the pool. Also outside pool is fairly small, not providing a fair space to move. At the time of our stay there (in April), there was a disturbing odor of a urine in the air. The tiles were missing in the pool. There was only one vending machine in the area, so you could not sit and have a proper coffee inside the spa area. Big windows whit shelves, where you can lay on, are a great feature of this spa. Not being an \old sauna guy\"", I strongly believe, the saunas were all too hot. You can choose within 4 small saunas (Roman, Turkish, Finish and Infrared) Also thermometer confirmed that it was too hot in every single one of them. We guessed this is the case only because there was no personnel monitoring the temperatures and the humidity of the saunas, and no one was responsible to take care of this things. The bucket of water (to steam up finish sauna for instance) was available to everyone, and whoever wanted, could pour a water on the rocks. Having experiences with other spa (Olimia) where spa area was lightly perfumed with herb essences, where a staff person came and pour additional water in finish sauna, when the time was right, where there was a little bar in the spa complex, and it costed less, I would surely never come to Rimske toplice spa again. We had to pay extra for the towels and leave deposit for the bathrobe. Worth to see, and evaluate on your own, but leaving the high expectations out. :)""";Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026

Breakfast and dinner was great, plenty of choices, delicious... If you love to hike, near hotel you have many trails, go there, pure nature very peacefully...Minus :* you don’t have outdoor bar on the level that I would expect in a place with four stars. You have small kiosk with drinks and food like somewhere on the cheap coast* at the evening, on the reception floor you have some horror show with belly dancer and 80's lightshow.

Very nice weekend;4;20.06.2013;We spent a weekend in May at the Zdraviliški Dvor hotel. The whole complex looks new and modern. The indoor and outdoor pool are connected so you can go outside through water. It was chilly outside during our visit but it made us enjoy the outdoor pool even more - steam rising from the hot water and the beautiful surroundings ...Only objection about the pool is that hydro-massage features are not working all the time but they are switched on every 10-15 minutes or so. Food and room were pretty good. Sauna complex is very nice.There is a great choice of romantic baths, massages etc, but we did not try those.It was not crowded during our visit, altogether a nice quiet getaway.;Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026
Hotel Sofijin Dvor: excellent !;5;1.04.2013;We spent Easter Time in Hotel Sofijin Dvor. At Rimske Terme there are 3 Hotels all connected. Even if the weather was bed we spent a very good time thanks to the excellent accommodation. The meals at the buffet were very good at breakfast and dinner. The room at Hotel Sofijin Dvor is really very comfortable and if you book the room with balcony is very big with a very good landscape. There are swimming pools inside and outsides, saunas and a very good wellness and Gym. All the staff is really very friendly and nice. It’s also nice to stay inside the Hotel because it’s very comfortable: all the common spaces are very nice and good. The Rimske Terme Hotel is in a very nice place in the nature and it’s possible to have a lots of walks all-around of it and there is a very good landscape from the Hotel.

Everything is in marvel, probably like romans had 2000 years ago.Breakfast was good too, with organic-food corner.Rooms are clean, spaceous, with roman sayings. Also some nice wievs to the valley from hotel windows and pools.The hotel has a fitness too, with special children-fitness in it.

All of them are fantastic and together with Enya's music coming constantly \""from the walls\"" you are going directly to Nirvana:-)One tip, if you need a complete relaxation just avoid, if possible, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.

perfect;5;4.11.2012;We just returned from a long weekend in Slovenia, the country we admire and visit every year. This time we chose Rimske terme, hotel Rimski dvor and I think we will revisit as soon as possible. The nature is beyond lovely with sequoia trees over 100 years old and hills and green pastures. It is secluded so it is a perfect getaway. Rooms are clean, huge and modern with a lovely touches such as old mirror or latin proverbs etc. Staff are friendly and nice young people . And the spa..saunas, massages, fitness...it is a bliss! The outdoor swimming pool is pure pleasure. Swimming in a warm water and watching snowy hills and inhaling cold morning air is priceless.

Excellent value;4;24.09.2012;Rimske terme is a recently carefully renovated old Austrian spa. The prices are extremely affordable: you usually pay less than a half of the usual price in one of the Slovenian spas.The rooms are very modern, clean and comfortable if a bit small. There's everything you need and even more: from a very good shampoo and a sewing kit to a nice bathrobe and slippers. The corridors are a bit tricky: you always have a feeling that you will get lost in a labyrinth. The self service buffet (breakfast+dinner) was rich and the food was nice if a little bland. The inside/outside pool complex is well designed and gives an impression of an old Roman bath. The sauna complex is nice and completely new. It provides four saunas, a cold and a warm jacuzzi. There are three jacuzzies outside, however, they did not seem very clean. An overall impression is that the sauna complex should be larger and offer more variety considering the size of the hotel.The staff is extremely helpful and friendly.;Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026

The food in the hotel was very good and tasty (but we only had one dinner).

Did not meet our expectations;4;8.03.2012;Me and my husband go to spa resorts at least twice a year, almost always to Slovenia. Although we already have a favorite resort, we try to visit a different one each time we go so this time it was Rimske terme. Although there is really nothing bad about them, we were still not too happy about this resort. It somehow lacked a special touch that would put it higher on the list of preferred places. The rooms are very nice, everything is new and clean, the service is good, the food is good, it could be better in hotel of such category. The swimming pool is definitely the best part, unique design and not crowded. Saunas are OK but nothing special. The resort is set in the middle of nowhere and even the cafe in the hotel closes at 10 p.m. If you like to go out in the evening the first place (Laško) is 7 km away. However, about 15 km away there is a fantastic restaurant which is worth the trip.;Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026
Still looking for it's niche;3;4.02.2012;To be honest I grabbed really good offer and stayed in this hotel for a couple of days with my wife. The rooms are small but nice, the breakfast is average but diverse, the spa is the most beautiful I've ever seen but ... If you can see there is always one 'but' in my sentence so that is what this beautiful resort very well placed in the nature is missing. Since it's running only its third year I think they still have the room for improvement - for example: what is this place meant to be ? The spa for grown ups relaxing after busy days - it's missing the atmosphere, family resort - it's missing the pools and slides for kids. I think they tend to go for the first choice but at the end you get the mixture of both. And one thing more - what todo after the dinner ?;Rimske Terme Hotel;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceRimskeTermeHotel;Toplice 10, Rimske Toplice 3272, Slovenia;46.1192261;15.2033026

We were there for 3 days.. and we had electricity in bathroom just first day... no lights no hairdryer.. we reported that to reception.. and nobody was there to fix it... not that day.. not the other day..not the day when we went away.. in the room was so damn hot that we couldnt sleep ... we couldnt turn off the radiator.. it was like in sauna so we didnt have to go to sauna in terme 3000.. but we went to a pool.. That was really miserable... they said they will renovate hotel form may to july but it is sad that they worked and kept it open for the people to come to see that rust on mainholes in every pool in that area... it isnt such cheap experience for that trash they are selling there. I hope that it will be much better when they renovate all that area.. from bungalows to terme center. I like Prekmurje so so much.. it is the most beautiful place to be in Slovenia. Food is good.. people are awesome, very very kind.. and Im so sorry for myself for picking the Terme 3000. But Ill go back.. Ill visit it again when they renovate that cause it is difficult to me to leave it like that :) im so sorry that i dont have any photo but it was nonsense to take any photo from there.;Terme 3000;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceTerme3000;Kranjcheva ulica 12, Moravske Toplice 9226, Slovenia;46.683883;16.2191458
Great location for spring road biking;4;3.04.2016;It is a nice camp close to a giant Therme. Quite and relaxing in April. I guess a little more crowded in summer. Super clean facilities and a great area for road biking with nice streets and not to many hills for our spring legs. After a day of riding you can enjoy a relaxing evening in the sauna if hotel Ajda, which you can book for 5 € per day per person. Really splendid for a couple of days.;Terme 3000;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceTerme3000;Kranjcheva ulica 12, Moravske Toplice 9226, Slovenia;46.683883;16.2191458
"\relax, quiet hotel with delicious food\""""";5;8.10.2015;We stay in a Hotel Livada Prestige. The room was big, we had two bathrooms, a balcony,available wi-fi. It was quiet, so the room was perfect for relax and to have a nice sleep.. It was very clean. The pools were clean, water was warm. There was not too much crowds, specially in the evening. We really like to eat, so I was fascinated about the food! There was a lot of very delicious food. You realy can enjoy in all of different kinds of food. I will like to commend Dolores Titan and receptionist Mojca, for all the kindness and obligingness.

Relaxing;4;14.10.2014;It was a spontaneous decision to stay at Moravsky Toplice, but we found this hotel and thought it would be a good idea.We got a small double house for 4 persons and they were okay to live in. The bathroom was clean, but there wasn't a lot of room in the bedroom - but if you just want to sleep there, then it's okay:)The pools were clean and if you use them in the late evening you won't have to share them with so many people.But what I got to compliment big time - was the food! Breakfast or dinner - it was all delicious and there was a lots and lots to choose from!

Much fun with waterslides and thermal water;4;30.07.2011;We stayed at the appartment area Prekmurska vas (4 star).Since we booked a smaller room (for 3 persons), it was rather tight for 2 adults and 2 kids (8-year-old twins). The appartment area is approx. 10 min. walking distance from the hotel Termal where we had breakfast and dinner buffet.The meals were nice and varied. The restaurant staffs were friendly.The pools and the thermal water were worth visiting. We didn't try the Aqua Loop, since it was for person over 10 years old and I myself have a fear of heights. But the other waterslides were fun.It would be nice to stay there over a week, making some bicycle tours and hikings also.;Terme 3000;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceTerme3000;Kranjcheva ulica 12, Moravske Toplice 9226, Slovenia;46.683883;16.2191458
Lipa, kavarna-pivnica-restavracija-great food, best steak ever;5;22.05.2017;I visited the Terme Olimia with my family and went for lunch to Lipa - kavarna, pivnica, restavracija which is a restaurant near the main pool complex. We ordered different kinds of food and everything we got on the table was really good. From meat to sea food. The two kids had some meatballs with mashed potatoes, the grown-ups got various kinds of meat and/or sea food. We got home-made pasta, a great octopus dish, a fresh wiener schnitzel, beautiful chicken wings and the best Argentinian beef steak that had the desired doneness and was just perfect. The staff was super friendly, but not intrusive, and totally professional. I would recommend this restaurant for couples, families and friends. You can enjoy your meal (paired with a big variety of beers and wines) outside or in the beautiful interior space. We were super happy and the prices were more than reasonable.;Terme Olimia;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceTermeOlimia;Zdravilishka cesta 24, Podcetrtek 3254, Slovenia;46.1582667;15.6068705

Maximum Relaxation ;4;11.01.2017;My boyfriend and I stayed at Hotel Sotelia for three nights. It was very beautiful and very relaxing. The rooms were comfortable and we could even order our preferred pillow type free of charge to add to an even better night's sleep! I thought this was a nice touch. The spa is located underground and fed by natural hot spring water. It has an indoor/outdoor pool and a large wall of windows opening up to the outdoor area. There are many separate tubs of varying temperatures and jets/bubbles. This section is for hotel guests only. There is also a public side we had access to with our wrist bands, somewhat similar. My favourite was the spa and saunas in the 15+ (clothing free) side, courtesy of Hotel Sotelia. There were many instructor-led group classes to join. Infra red sauna, steam rooms, cold pool, showers, and relaxation rooms. Even an outdoor rooftop hot tub and sitting area overlooking the outdoor area. I appreciated the water fountains for thermal drinking water throughout. The spa treatments were lovely, even though this was peak season, the ladies at the booking desk worked very hard to get me into a couple sessions. Thanks ladies! I enjoyed an extremely relaxing back massage, and a rejuvenating reflexology foot massage. They are very professional and experienced. There are many more options to choose from! Very impressive. The food was also wonderful as it had regional flair, yet classic dishes. Staff were very knowledgeable while speaking many different languages. I'm sure I'll return in the future and definitely recommend this experience to others!

At entry you get braclet that is your ticket and paying instrument so no worry about money. The only thing we didn't like is that wireless internet is available only when you punch in code from receipt and then its valid only for one hour.

Wonderful Relaxing Experience;5;14.09.2016;Terme Olimia, situated in north eastern Slovenia near the Croatian border, is an amazing spa complex which unsurprisingly is frequently referred to as the best in Slovenia.Terme Olimia comprises Wellness Centres Orchidelia and Thermalja, as well the nearby Aqualuna Water Park. Various packages and a multitude of massage services are available, with Orchidelia being modern, luxurious and beautiful with its coloured and relaxingly lit pools, jacuzzis and the like, whilst Thermalja is more attune to a family environment with a diversity of offerings.From an accommodation point of view, within Terme Olimia there is the option of the recently fully refurbished Sotelia Hotel (which incorporates the wonderful Spa Armonia), or the Brevia Hotel, both of which are rated 4 star.Arising out of our 3 night stay (and having previously stayed at other spa centres in Slovenia), my wife and I could not speak highly enough about the facilities and services on offer. For anyone after a relaxing get away and change of pace of life, would have no hesitation in recommending Terme Olimia, which in our opinion certainly lived up to its reputation as the best in Slovenia.;Terme Olimia;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceTermeOlimia;Zdravilishka cesta 24, Podcetrtek 3254, Slovenia;46.1582667;15.6068705

Waterpark Aqualuna;4;1.09.2016;Went to the Aqualuna waterpark for one day and it was pretty awesome. The whole waterpark is designed as i don't know, some kind of a junge, so when you choose the place where you'll put your towels and everything - you will be surrounded with a bunch of animal statues. I have choosen panda bears to keep me company :D This place is perfect for kids due to many many slides and that one pool that really looks like a jungle. And at the top of it there is a bucket that's filling with water and turns over every minute. (I was waiting down there for water to splash me just as a kid, it was perfect) it can really awaken a child within you. There are slides for grown-ups as well. I just cannot describe the Cobra waterslide, it is worth trying. As for the food and drinks, it was average.

Aqualuna waterpark;4;6.07.2016;Aqualuna is Water Park is part of Terme Olimia complex. It is great place for family trip with kids. The place is clean, it has several water slides, not made for adrenalin junkies, but suitable for kids. Two slides (yellow one Kamikaze) is not allowed for kids’ younger than 16, but from my perspective they should reconsider that decision. King Cobra slide is main attraction and it is a lot of fun! They also organize animation for their guests.The best thing about Aqualuna is that there is no crowd, for weekends also, so even for King Cobra slide you do not wait more than few minutes for ride. If you go there take the food with you, not because of the price. On the other hand their ice cream is great.;Terme Olimia;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceTermeOlimia;Zdravilishka cesta 24, Podcetrtek 3254, Slovenia;46.1582667;15.6068705

Termal Complex - Terme Olimia;4;27.04.2016;In that complex you have at least 4 hotels and we have token Hotel Sotelia with the Wellness Orhidelia and restaurant for breakfast and bar Barago for a snack if necessary.

For us best Spa in this region;5;13.03.2016;This spa is for sure the best one in this region. We have stayed in Olimia more than 7 times in last 5 years, sometimes for 2 nights, sometimes for 1 day. Usually we stayed in aparthotel Rosa, where we have everything we need. Apartments are equipped with all necessary appliances, clean and tidy and quiet for vacation. Staff is very polite and friendly, do their best to meet customer requirements. The best thing for us is that we can reach the pools and saunas through tunel from our apartment.The pools in Termalia are rather tired and would need a major refreshment. We usually take one day for part called Orhidelia. It offers lot of saunas and pools, with high standards and quality. We prefer to use Orhidelia during the working days because it is crowded on weekends. The service is professional, but the price is rather high.;Terme Olimia;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceTermeOlimia;Zdravilishka cesta 24, Podcetrtek 3254, Slovenia;46.1582667;15.6068705

It offers lot of saunas and pools, with high standards and quality.Orhidelia js the part with great pools, both inside and outside. Since the water is warm it js great to come in wintertime. It also offers some saunas. Termalia js the part with great saunas - at least 10 of them.

Nicer than Tuhelj;4;17.02.2016;We visited the spa for a day since we had a free pass. The pool are is so much nicer than the one in Tuhelj. Our 7-year old had much more fun.

Still to improve!;3;7.02.2016;My wife and I spent a weekend in Terme Olimia. As we had our dog with us, we were not able to get a room in any hotel. So we stayed in an apartment in Vas Lipa (Lipa Village). The apartment was suitable for our needs, nice and clean, but maybe needs some renewal.We had our meals in Hotel Breza. I would give them 3 in the scale of five for the food and for the overall impression. What bothered me the most was too many guest in the dining room in the same time, what caused a long lines when waiting for the food, as there was a buffet for the breakfast and dinner.In our package only the pools in the wellness center Termailja was included. But as we are not very exited about overcrowded pools, and we would have to pay 11€ to be able to enter the saunas, we decided to add 21€ and enter well-known and more exclusive wellness, called Orhidelia. It is really something special, and I was impressed by sauna programs, they are performing there. If I would stop writing here, I would give them maybe even 5 for that SPA (or maybe 4, because of the high price, that we had to pay – but probably it is worth).But I proceed writing! So my note is a low 3. Why? Because of the overcrowded saunas, when the program was taking place. I think they would even don’t need to turn on the heater in the sauna, because there was so many people crowding in the sauna. But one again, the program was extraordinary!But I must give my compliments to very friendly staff in Terme Olimia. Receptionists, waiters, cleaning ladies, etc., nor for one I would have one bad comment.Nevertheless, we spent a very nice weekend there!;Terme Olimia;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceTermeOlimia;Zdravilishka cesta 24, Podcetrtek 3254, Slovenia;46.1582667;15.6068705

Not the best spa in Slovenia;3;31.01.2016;It is highly advertised as the best spa in slovenia so my expectations were high. Thermal water is not to my liking, after a while your skin gets very dry. Thermal pool area Termalia for me looks old-fashioned. with white gray big tiles and big jacuzzi where you can not sit but only stand looks kind of old and worn down. Also it was overcrowded the weekend when we stayed so you couldnt get a resting chair as there were already very few of them in the first place. Fitness room too small, not even worth mentioning. Orhidelia, I thought, would be a lot different. It is a newer construction with a lot a similarly big pool area and a lot of places (chairs) to rest. Black tiles in the entrance give impression of luxury. Nevertheless it is also worn down (not good maintained). outside the colour is peeling from the tiles in the pool. Water feels colder than the displayed temperature. Also it is planned to be a perfect resting place for the guests who normally pay over 20 eur per person to get inside this luxurious place. Unfortunately there are too many people inside, not only people but small children and babies who are very loud and splash in the pools so you cannot get any rest. On the other hand there were many people who visited upstairs sauna and went to the poolside naked, which for me is big minus considering there are children there. one time a mid aged man walked in our big jacuzzi pool inside the pools area totally naked and started diving showing his naked butt to 6 of us present there. Sauna areas are places where you would expect this. There are 2 separate rooms of sauna, finish saunas and turkish saunas. They are very nice and clean when they are not overcrowded (early in the morning). 2 times we were there, there were so many people in saunas it was almost disgusting. also the resting place with water-beds is excellent. The bad thing is that some people were also naked there in the not appropriate conduct, which in my opinion is not a place to do that but to rest between saunas and not bother other guests. My overall opinion of this place is that it is visited by younger people (couples) who want to be seen here (as it is quite expensive), people who have very little culture in being at spa and saunas so the overall impression of this place is ruined by that. It is good thing that we didnt pay extra to get inside as the web page orhidelia . com offers staying in olimia hotels for reduced prices with free entrance to orhidelia. maybe it is because of that, this place was overcrowded? anyways, not the best spa in slovenia, not recommended for rest.;Terme Olimia;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceTermeOlimia;Zdravilishka cesta 24, Podcetrtek 3254, Slovenia;46.1582667;15.6068705
Luxury Relax area Orhidelia - Fully overcrowded, people leaving towels on paths, saunas overbooked;1;25.01.2016;"We have stayed in Olimia more than 10 times in last 2 years, sometimes for 3 nights, sometimes for 1 day. It was always excellent peaceful, quiet and relaxing. Staff is very polite and friendly.Food is excellent.Sauna areas were always normally filled with people, not overcrowded, pool areas also.On 23rd January 2016 we decided to visit for 1 day (and on 29th January we had reservation for 2 nights - 3 days).On 23rd January .. first time ever (as far as we have seen) .. Olimia was overcrowded, getting into sauna was near impossible, people were waiting in line for 40 minutes to get into sauna...Getting into smaller jacuzzi (10 people) or normal pools .. was also near impossible because people were \holding their spots\"" .. We managed to grab 2 beds in Sauna area... while some less lucky people were literally carrying their stuff because there was just not enough space.All saunas, all pools, all areas were constantly full from 11AM until our departure (approx 17.30PM). We managed to dip twice into smaller jacuzzi, we managed to grab once a spot in sauna...Anyway, for 100-130% bigger price it's a big failure of adventure.Also we have canceled our reservation for 29th January because we have been told it will be the same (again overcrowded).We have asked hotel management how is that possible that so called \""luxury\"" and \""relaxing\"" spa is overcrowded like that... received no reply.. just ignoring us and pretending it didn't happen.""";Terme Olimia;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceTermeOlimia;Zdravilishka cesta 24, Podcetrtek 3254, Slovenia;46.1582667;15.6068705

Orhidelia is the best wellness in Slovenia;5;26.05.2015;Me and my husband just love wellnesses and we like to try as many as we can. I can say that throughout the years we visited different wellnesses around Slovenia and this one is by far the best one.Normally we stay in Sotelia, but you can also stay in other hotels that are all a part of Terme Olimia. The whole complex is situated in the beautiful countryside offering plenty of outdoor activities. Sotelia would be the most expensive of the hotels and the prices normally go higher than 100EUR per person per night, half board basis. The room price normally includes the entrence into Termalia wellness. If you want to go into Orhidelia wellness you have to pay extra or you book a package that includes the entrence into Orhidelia. The rooms in Sotelia are spacious, the beds very comfortable. The bathrooms offer lots of toiletries. The staff is extremely helpful and polite.Breakfast offers great variety of organic and healthy products. Dinner selection is also generous.The biggest plus for us is wellness Orhidelia. It feels like a piece of heaven on Earth. It is huge and offers everything you need, from saunas to massage beds, lots of indoor and outdoor pools. If you want a massage you again have different choices. Normally we book massages in Spa Armonia. I like thai massage the best. If you feel hungry, Restaurant Pomun offers healthy snacks, smoothies, sandwiches, lunches and the best 100% natural ice-cream.I would say this is a place to be if you want to recharge your batteries. But don't forget it can be quite pricy.;Terme Olimia;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceTermeOlimia;Zdravilishka cesta 24, Podcetrtek 3254, Slovenia;46.1582667;15.6068705

It's the newer part of the complex and a really fancy one.Big pools with underwater music (yes, you read that right), there are 5 or 6 saunas, IR, finnish, turkish...They have a lot of quiet resting places, with big beds for 2 people, there is also a room with water beds.Everything is really modern, \fancy\"" if you would like to call it like that.It's not on the cheap end, but definitly worth the visit if you are nearby.Would give it 10 stars if that was possible :D""";Terme Olimia;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceTermeOlimia;Zdravilishka cesta 24, Podcetrtek 3254, Slovenia;46.1582667;15.6068705
Modern and new;5;22.03.2015;We've been in the new part of this spa, named Orhidelia, about ten times and the only problem is that when you visit this place once you don't want to go anywhere else! So we did! Relaxation for body and soul in the beautiful and modern designed interior with friendly staff. It's hard to talk about experience in this place with words. You must feel it by visiting this place!;Terme Olimia;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceTermeOlimia;Zdravilishka cesta 24, Podcetrtek 3254, Slovenia;46.1582667;15.6068705
Very modern and well maintained spa;5;5.03.2015;We stayed at the Sotelia hotel for a weekend, enjoying their spa center, saunas, whirlpools and good food. The rooms are very nice, clean, enjoyable. Lots of choices from dinner menu. The price is very fair for the offered.

Pure pampering!;5;16.02.2015;This spa is the best place for winter relaxation. All pools are warm, water clean, beds comfortable. The staff is kind and welcoming. The spa is big so you can do different things each day - swim, go to sauna, get massage, sleep etc. I like the lavender color which is the main color of all the facilities, so soothing...There's an entrance fee, you're given a chip bracelet so you can move freely and forget about carrying the wallet. If you're a guest of one of the nearby hotels, your fee is a bit lower.Also there are many walking paths around the complex you can use and see the castle, the Podcetrtek town or some other landmarks. If the weather is nice, got to one of cafes in Podcetrtek and enjoy the sunshine!;Terme Olimia;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceTermeOlimia;Zdravilishka cesta 24, Podcetrtek 3254, Slovenia;46.1582667;15.6068705
Affordable Wellness Luxury ;5;10.02.2015;I am regular guest of Terme Olimia because the staff is very friendly, it is very clean and well organized (no cash required within complex). Wellcard lotalty programm is excellent for regular guests.Tipically I visit Termalia and Sauna World a few times a month for pleasant relaxation. I try not miss any sauna programmes which are held by Slovenia's best sauna professionals. Termalia offers indoor and outdoor pools with water attractions and self service restaurant. You and your children will have full day of water fun at affordable price.When I want luxury and space - I strech my wallet a bit for Orchidelia. It is a mix of indoor and outdoor pools, spas and saunas, very good on-pool restaurant, large lockers and private shower rooms. Entry fee includes bathrobe and towel. Key word is space, a lot of space and self-pampering. Try not to miss free of charge sauna programs. No textile friday evenings (FKK) and late night working hours on fridays and saturdays (open till midnight).Massages in Termalia and Orchidelia are really excellent. Try house specials - especially Amala and Vitae.TIP: On the bottom of any receipt will find Wi-Fi code for ine hour of Internet. Acommodation offer is also rich here. Hotels Sotelia and Breza offer variety of standards and designs. If you like apartments, I can also recommend staying in Olimia.Surroundings offer interesting sites for walking and hiking, chocolate factory and other gastronomic delights. I haven't visited summer complex Aqualuna. It is on my to-do. :);Terme Olimia;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceTermeOlimia;Zdravilishka cesta 24, Podcetrtek 3254, Slovenia;46.1582667;15.6068705

Impressing pools and saunas;4;7.01.2015;We stayed in Therme Olimia (Sotelia) for three nights. I enjoyed it. It was a lovely combination of walks, breathing and relaxing in pools and saunas. Our room was spacious and cozy, with everything needed - slippers, gowns, nice cosmetics, convenient shower. I did not like the pillows though, they were flat and a bit untidy, it felt like many people have used them before..And pieces of soap provided were really tiny, ridiculosely small! The breakfast is really rich and various! It included interesting local dishes, like cottage cheese with truffle oil, etc. I was surprised, that there was a queue to get coffee (by the way, coffee was not tasty).Dinner buffet is delicious as well, I can recommend it.In the evening there was nice live music in Barago bar.The pool territory in Termalia is huge! We especially enjoyed swimming outside - unbelievably relaxing and real fun! The water is warm enough not to feel uncomfortably cold.The sauna world impressed me - I have rather big experience in SPA resorts, but have never seen so many types of saunas!! Maybe even too much - it takes special time to remember everything and realize, where to go, and try most of them.I was delighted with the bracelet system - if you forget the number of your box, it reminds. Complete relax!We were not ready to see so many naked men in saunas. There was a contrast: families with kids in pools, and mostly men without underwear in saunas. Feels like you came here by mistake. Confusing.The hotel is good, but there is not much to see and do near it. For three-five days - perfect, but not more. ;Terme Olimia;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceTermeOlimia;Zdravilishka cesta 24, Podcetrtek 3254, Slovenia;46.1582667;15.6068705
Orhidelia - one & only!;5;22.11.2014;We're regularly going and enjoying the spa, wellness and pools facilities in Serbia, Hungary, Croatia, Italy, Austria and Slovenia, but have never been in anything similar to Orhidelia section of Terme Omelia. I don't know for the rest of the complex, but the Orhidelia spa is the one of its kind and the place I will visit on regular basis (4.5 hours of regular drive from Belgrade) with my girlfriend whenever I have the opportunity for it.My only recomendation is that - although there is a more general area on the ground floor for the whole families - this place, especially on the first floor, is just for the couples only who would like to relax from the everyday life and to enjoy in the fabolous ambient, unique architecture and the beautiful and spacious spa contents. And, first of all, in his/her loving one.;Terme Olimia;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceTermeOlimia;Zdravilishka cesta 24, Podcetrtek 3254, Slovenia;46.1582667;15.6068705
The most luxuriest spa in Slovenia;5;6.10.2014;This is the best spa I have ever seen. Purple shades in the pool area, oval and separated pools with warm thermal water give you the impresion of isolation and your own private time.

Nice wellness;4;11.09.2014;We spent 3 days in terme olimia (hotel breza). Wellness orhidelia is very nice and modern with beautiful swimming pools,saunas and other atractions. Massages at spa amala were excellent as well. On the other side, wellness termalia is outdated and lacks activities and space. We were lucky cause it was not crowded. Aside from the wellness part I reccommend to visit deer farm and land of fairytales and fantasy (koca pri carovnici).;Terme Olimia;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceTermeOlimia;Zdravilishka cesta 24, Podcetrtek 3254, Slovenia;46.1582667;15.6068705

Orhidelia is GREAT. The rest is lower than advertised;4;26.08.2014;Stayed 3 nights, weekend included at Sotelia, in a single room. Nice design of the hotel, room had everything needed and was comfortable. 5/5 for design. Although the overall materials used and some details were somehow cheap and not at the quality level requested by the design. 3/5 for building. Had a nice big balcony with view to the front of the hotel, not very spectacular but quite ok.Rooms very overall clean, but not into deep details and corners. 3/5 for cleanliness.A PRO : every day fresh fruits in the room and a bottle of thermal water.Restaurant for breakfast and dinner buffet very crowded and narrow. Feels like school-like cantine not a 4 star superior restaurant. Food also average. You can upgrade your halfboard and eat in the a la carte restaurant, which is not really a la carte because it is having a fixed menu, 2 choices per course, but food is good. Breakfast can me moved to the spa. 4/5 for food, but just because the option of having something different than the buffet.Now coming to services in the hotel, they are really of a 3 stars hotel, not 4 stars superior. Although the lady at the reception was trying to do her best to help me out, there were some glitches. First, at night nobody at the reception, just security, who was very nice and tried to help me out with everything. Second, everything I would like I have to pay extra. Whether I have to upgrade something, or find out some hidden costs. Third, everything closes earlier than scheduled : lobby bar, restaurant, night club Zafran wasn't even open at all. Nobody cared about this. 3/5.(big CON for 4 star hotel - wireless internet is free just for one hour per day).Hotel atmosphere was cold and not customer centered. Somehow it felt industrial and false. Staff needs training and probably management needs training too.Overall hotel is 3/5, although design is excellent.Now coming to spa & wellness.Termalia, which is included in the prices, is crowded, cheap, a lot of kids, very noisy. Categorically not exclusive. Although it has 9 very good saunas with good programmes. I was wondering about cleanliness and hygiene at these... 3/5 for this facility.When it comes to Orhidelia, things get completely different. Very spacious Wellness area, with a very good design, something really special. Very good facilities, light effects, very clean, quiet and with plenty of space for any wishes. Saunas are only 5, but very special, especially the 2 steam baths. (At saunas you can go only without swimsuits). Sauna programmes are also good. You have a restaurant where you can even transfer your breakfast and have it late. Staff polite, but atmosphere still cold and not customer oriented. 5/5 for Orhidelia, it's the most impressive spa I've seen lately. You should although note that access to it costs extra. And you get it with only 2 entrances per day. Costs even more if you want unlimited entrances.Spa Armonia - had only one massage, Olimia massage. Highly recommended. Was very well and kindly treated there. Regards to the masseuse Daniela. I haven't visited other facilities of Terme Olimia.Overall Hotel Sotelia should be 3 stars superior. Orhidelia seems the top wellness center in the region and that saved the overall ranking.;Terme Olimia;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceTermeOlimia;Zdravilishka cesta 24, Podcetrtek 3254, Slovenia;46.1582667;15.6068705
3 most interesting points on one site;5;25.08.2014;Monastery - surprising luxury, deer farm, chocolate boutique. The place is so lovely! Easy to find which is not always a case. English texts in the monastery, so you can understand the topic. Deer farm is beyond the monastery 100 m up and chocolate - walk from the monastery to the right if you face it.;Terme Olimia;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceTermeOlimia;Zdravilishka cesta 24, Podcetrtek 3254, Slovenia;46.1582667;15.6068705
Eh, nothing special;3;20.08.2014;So, there are a few pools, the one with rubbery floors is horribly full of chlorine. Nothing special really, but ok. The restaurant there is horribly expensive in regards to the neighbouring restaurants and the smell off burnt oil carries up to the appartments. Yuck!

Relaxing spa;5;14.07.2014;Once a year we visit Terme Olimje. To be more specific, wellness Orhidelia. I do not know, whether the season is the answer, but normally there is not a lot of people. This is good. At such places I hate too many crowd. The spa offers many interesting pools, saunas and Jacuzzi’s. You can take a massage or simply relax by the pool. The spa offers outdoors and indoors locations. Maybe outside there is not enough sun loungers. Everything else is perfect. Inside you have Turkish, infrared, steam saunas. The complex was built 5 years ago, but is still very modern. If you are staying in Terme Olimje, my recommendation is Orhidelia, not Thermalia, where is much bigger crowd.;Terme Olimia;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceTermeOlimia;Zdravilishka cesta 24, Podcetrtek 3254, Slovenia;46.1582667;15.6068705

There are children's pools which offer many water attractions for children all categories. Our children were so amazed they hadn't time for eating and got a rest for a while. I loved a relaxation pool with massage seats and also pool with waves. There is a tower with a lot of water slides too. There are very pretty statues of jungle animals all over the aquapark.

The SPA is more than Great;5;5.10.2013;It is very funny when you read the previous ratings, specially when you read about being forced to put off the clothes when entering the saunas. Spas are an European invention and also reflect a certain life style, to be nude in the sauna is not only perfectly normal, but also important to keep up hygenic standards. The funny thing is, that special people of the country which houses then worlds largest porn industry are showing off to be very shy. The spa and then restaurants are great, the staff is exceptional friendly and even that it's just a little village around the corner, you can do a lot in your pastime. For me Terme Olimia is a very hot location, for private travel, business meetings and as far as I saw, families enjoy the stay here as well. ;Terme Olimia;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceTermeOlimia;Zdravilishka cesta 24, Podcetrtek 3254, Slovenia;46.1582667;15.6068705

You would be doing yourself a disservice if you do not dedicate an entire day to enjoy this place.There were more pools, saunas and steam rooms of so many different varieties, you can easily get lost in all of the ways you can relax there.There are also many resting areas, waterbeds, tanning rooms and a restaurant to enjoy some healthy meal options as well as fresh juices.The spa is nicely appointed and clean.I left the Olimia with every ounce of stress having left my body.Go and experience a different level of relaxation!;Terme Olimia;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceTermeOlimia;Zdravilishka cesta 24, Podcetrtek 3254, Slovenia;46.1582667;15.6068705

The pool is very nice and you are allowed to wear a bathing suit there but I mostly went for the saunas and was very upset I couldn't go unless I went in nude. They were just yelling at me that \everywhere is same!\"" But I have gone to spas in Dominican Republic, U.S, and in Mexico and never was it required to strip down.

My comment on Orhidelia: amazing ambience but fire the chef!;3;30.04.2013;"Orhidelia without doubt is a very nice thermal center, primarily beacause it's architecturally significant and brand new (a couple of years old actually). OK, the surrounding landscape is depressing, but what can one expect from an unsignifficant Slovenian frontier town... I can only hope the management will invest in it's renovation when it starts decaying (the first signs of aging can unfortunately already be seen). It has great pools, great saunas, great relaxation areas that I could give 4-5 stars if it wasn't for the crowds and the awful restaurant.1. do not even think about going there during holidays (especially Easter) unless you want to wander around hopelessly looking for a free bed. Swimming was virtually impossible at that time, saunas so full you had to wait for one person to come out so that you could enter. 99% of guests are Italian and Russian, btw. There should definitely be a maximum number of visitors allowed, like it is in Austria (Bad Blumau for example).2. the so called restaurant serving \fusion Italian-Asian\"" food is hands down the worst place I have ever eaten in in 20 years. I was ashamed to be Slovenian after having finished (left most of) my portion of overcooked spaghetti observing Italian guests' face expressions while tasting theirs. I really felt sorry for them. The soup was supposed to be an \""oriental soup with pineapple and shrimps\"". What I got was a clear fatty beef soup with three shrunken shrimps floating in it and 5 micro pieces of pineapple. I could not believe my eyes (not to mention the taste!). If you do get hungry, the desserts and coffee are admittedly not that bad. They really need to fire their chef as soon as possible! And it wouldn't hurt the waiters to smile either.""";Terme Olimia;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceTermeOlimia;Zdravilishka cesta 24, Podcetrtek 3254, Slovenia;46.1582667;15.6068705

Unprofessional;2;12.09.2012;As we were in the neighbourhood yesterday (100 km away) from Terme Olimia and had the whole day free, my boyfriend and I decided to go for a swim in Wellness Orhidelia. At first we wanted to make a reservation and stay over the night but we had to give up because of urgent obligations the next day.We came there around 10 a.m. and saw that we even can't go in the Terme because the entrance road was under construction.The road workers made us park the car across. We came in to buy the tickets and my boyfriend accidentaly saw some note on the desk that said that the indoor pools of Orhidelia are being cleaned for 3 days and can't be used then. We could only enter outdoor pools and saunas for a price that was only under 20% discount due to cleaning. The price of 22€ per person (with discount)was too much for us to use just 3 pools so we turned around and left.It would be OK that we didn't made 200 kilometers over bumpy country roads trough the villages of Slovenia and their smells of manure just because Terme Olimia couldn’t put on their web site that they are in the three day pool cleaning process.It is a good thing that we didn’t made the reservations for the night because we would absolutely go insane. I think they could clean the pools in one day, maximum two, if they worked during the night..

To be honest, I was quite curious about this place, because I have heart a lot (there were some TV Shows about this place in Slovakia) but nobody from my friends nor relatives have ever visited Terme Olimia. Reviews on tripadvisor.com were good so I decided to go. Terme Olimia are quite big complex. I have not seen it all - because there was not time (1 day is not enough) and therefore I can only write about few places: Hotel Sotelia (see my review there), Wellness Orchidelija, Wellness Termalija, Restaurant (Goscisce) Lipa.Wellness Orchidelija - Top of the class wellness. It is really nice and luxurious Wellness center (purple color prevails). Nice relaxing music, whirlpool, kid's pool (0.5m water), bar and luxurious leather deck-chairs. Water in all pools has above 30 degrees of Celsius but you have to pay extra to get in.Wellness Termalia - nice wellness all in blue tones (blue swimming pools). You can expect a lot of people here because it is used free of charge by 3 hotels (included in a price of the room) Hotel Sotelia, Hotel Breza and Aparthotel Rosa. There are even 2 slides for kids. One is for very small children (up to 4 years) and the second one is for older kids. You can find there 7 pools (if not more) with water above 30 degrees of Celsius.Restaurant Lipa - this is small restaurant on a tiny square in Terme Olimia. I can recommend it, mainly \Mushroom soup in bread cup\"" and great dessert Gibanica.I was not expecting anything so maybe therefore my impression was so great. I believe that we will visit this place again. If you are reading this and considering whether to go or not, do not hesitate and go. But when you are booking, try to get some package and get to Orchidelija free of charge.""";Terme Olimia;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceTermeOlimia;Zdravilishka cesta 24, Podcetrtek 3254, Slovenia;46.1582667;15.6068705

Good one!;4;3.05.2017;"This was our second time in this hotel, we were looking forward to come back with friends. Slovenia has excellent spas, this is one of the best.A few basic facts will follow.Pros:- excellent spa and pool area, heaven for kids and adults alike- spacious rooms- pool restaurant with decent prices- animation and play area for kids very good- beautiful nature around hotel- nice food, lots of variety- very available and friendly for people with disabilities- pet friendly- large free parking next to hotelCons:- should be avoided during bank holidays! Although large, pool area was so crowded that the staff hardly controlled the situation (cleanness and security disputable). Reason: external guests are allowed on the pool (apart from hotel guests), and the amount of people was really unpleasant to bare.- food stations in the restaurant are chaotic, people jump into one another; the staff tend not to refill the food in the evening, so if you come to dinner later, there is not much choice- although free, internet was poor (due to overcrowded hotel)- choice of music in the lobby bar in the evening is disputable But I like Slovenia so much, and I will keep coming back here or anywhere else!";Thermana Park Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceThermanaParkLasko;Zdravilishka cesta 6, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1616546;15.2320868
disaster;1;2.05.2017;I was really disapointed of the service that i got! First off all the receptionist on the thermana park was in a bad mood and i can say her alltitude was not appropriate!

Good!;4;23.04.2017;The hotel is well equipped and has a direct connection with the thermal area without passing through the lobby.Rooms are cozy and with large bathrooms.Cleanliness is good even if having a low carpet all along the room areas.Breakfast is well varied and the room is quite big.What I didn't find on the same level (it's a 4 stars hotel superior) is the mattress (too hard) and the quality of the food at dinner. You can always find something good, but you have to make selections. The room has no possibility to cool down if not opening the window (we were here during spring period) which makes the night extremely warm. That's why I don't give the highest rating.People at reception is nice and ready to help guests.;Thermana Park Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceThermanaParkLasko;Zdravilishka cesta 6, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1616546;15.2320868
I expected more but got average hotel;3;19.12.2016;I stayed in this hotel 4 days (3 nights). In the hotel I came on the recommendation of a friend. The hotel is in a great location for holiday.The staff are lovely, the hotel is extremely clean and well maintained. The pools are clean, but the water was cold for my taste. The rooms are large, clean, with comfortable beds. Big gripe is that the room where we were (number 135) has no carpets in the room!!! What is unacceptable for a hotel of this category! For dinner there is not enough food if you arrive later, there has been little guests in the hotel because it was a working day. The food is fresh and delicious.From the hotel to this category (4 star superior) I expected more.

Love the settling of the hotel;5;14.11.2016;It is settled by the river, with direct exit from a hotel to the bridge (pedestrian only), where you can start your nice walk by the river. You can take also nice walk uphill to the castle with great restaurant. Hotel itself is very nice and comfortable, it is all new. There is enough water fun inside for small kids, maybe not enough for bigger one (during the winter, when you can't use the outside part). For us it was enough for 3 days and we were all satisfied. Husband gave very good review about massages, too. I liked the food selection at self-service restaurant, I just really don't like that no one from workers there has a smile on his face. We had suite (r. Nr. 425) it is one of the top corners of the building, with very nice view on the river and also the parking lot side. Heating/ventilation can be too loud sometimes and in our room (in childrens bedroom, where one corner is all in glass) it was all wet on a rainy day. Not few drops, but each time someone forgot about it and was walking there, had to change his socks again). Otherwise it was very spacious and we were satisfied with it. We went to ground floor cafe few times and tried all the things from monthly offer and liked them all (smoothie, cakes and monk's tea). Also the prices are reasonable. There were young couples, families with kids and also elderly people so it is suitable for everyone. ;Thermana Park Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceThermanaParkLasko;Zdravilishka cesta 6, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1616546;15.2320868

Superb hotel for a stay in Slovenia;5;6.09.2016;We stayed here at the end of August. We took 2 rooms on the river side: one was occupied by our 2 kids en one for us (the parents). The rooms are clean, spacious and really modern. I found the best shower I ever had in this bathroom, really powerfull! And the hallway is super impressive...Breakfast in the hotel is good with a large variety of dishes. I would have liked to see some variations over the days, e.g. one day some donuts, the next day fresh waffles etc. But in all this is only a detail.For the dinner: a lot of things to choose from. My wife and daughter are both allergic to garlic and they got every day an explanation from the chef what they could pick from the buffet. The only negative point was that there was not always a lot of garlic-free choices to pick from... Good desserts!The pools are just great. The inside pool is impressive, especially when they open the roof when the weather is great. There are jacuzi pools everywhere... In the weekends the pools can be rather busy since a lot of Slovenian people are then coming for a swim to the hotel. But then there was also additional animation, so we still loved it!;Thermana Park Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceThermanaParkLasko;Zdravilishka cesta 6, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1616546;15.2320868

Mixed feelings;4;13.07.2016;First of all, this is a beautiful hotel. Neat, spatial rooms. Very modern with a well equipped wellness area, a big swimming accommodation and a reasonably equipped fitness room.The breakfast is delightful, you can choose from a lot of different plates going from warm meals over pancakes, to fruit. It is served as a buffet, where the eggs are baked on demand. You can also choose from several local products. What is not so nice in the buffet is the coffee, this is either prepared coffee from a ton, or nescafe from a machine. Both are not really good.Also the diner buffet is very nice. Again a huge choice from different kinds of local and international food. This food is again delicious.The hotel itself is well organized, with even a special desk at the reception for giving tourist information, including walking and bike trails. You can even rent bikes from the hotel.The bar serves great drinks, especially the smoothies :)Maybe also important to know, the WIFI is spotless, it is not super fast, but it is stable and fast enough for most things.So why this title, well it comes from the fact that the accommodations from this hotel are open to the public. The pools are more like a subtropical aquapark which gets flooded by local people and tourist from many towns around. This makes it very crowdy with a lot of noise, they even have some kind of local DJ for the music.This is not really compatible with the wellness part of the hotel. Since that part is next to the pool area all the noise comes right through. So don't consider this hotel as a wellness resort, where you'll find tranquility. Kids can have a lot of fun in the pools though and the view on the river and mount Hum are spectacular.Prices in the hotel are more than reasonable.Most of the personnel is friendly and helpful, but not all are. Also not everyone of the personnel speaks English. But this seems more like a Slovenian thing, than anything else :)A lot of times sign, texts,... are only available in Slovenian :);Thermana Park Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceThermanaParkLasko;Zdravilishka cesta 6, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1616546;15.2320868

I expected more from a 4* superior;3;24.01.2016;I am writing from the overly crowded pools.. Screaming children everywhere during weekends.. Very chlored.. Stays in your nose for hours after you leave the pool. If you do not come early and leave your towels in the morning after 11am you will not find a free place/desk chair. Otherwise they have nice pools - very family friendly. It's connected to the outside pool and it's very nice when it snows outside and you are in the cozy pool. Quite clean. The saunas are actually very good. So many to choose from but sooo overcrowded. Kept really clean. They have various programs every hour but you can rarely get in because there is so much people! Some of those are also during dinner time so you can't possibly use them. The supplement is only 5 euros which seems quite cheap.Restaurant - where to start.. Again they are over capacity. For breakfast you practically have to bus your own table if you want to sit somewhere, so be prepared. The stuff is very slow so food/clean glasses are not brought for 15 minutes. Very similar is the situation during dinner time. But despite that I have to say that they have quite a large variety of food for breakfast and dinner. If you are on a special diet though do not expect much - only natutal root juice (no special bread or anything like we had in another 3* thermal hotel in Slovenia). I am not a great meat lover but theirs was exquisite. In 3 days we stayed you could not find too many repeated dishes. A small tip: you can use their tap water during dinner because it's natural (recommended by a waiter who we accidentally knew).Rooms - nice and clean. If you get the one with the river view and on a higher floor you won't be disappointed. If you ask for a double bed you will get one with a whole between. Also I only minded a little mold in the bathroom but otherwise ok. They have bathtubs and bides. The hair dryer it's actually better than you would expect for a hotel. A nice place to take a walk and enjoy nature.The stuff is nice and friendly. Recommend highly for families, but not couples. We had a special discount but otherwise quite extensive.;Thermana Park Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceThermanaParkLasko;Zdravilishka cesta 6, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1616546;15.2320868

Perfect for a family retreat;5;11.01.2016;5 days well spent at Thermana Park hotel. Location near the river perfect, breakfast and dinner buffet perfect, pools clean , not too many people. Staff very helpfull at all times. Lovely Spa zone, with relaxing Thai massages. Gym a bit small, but has all the equipment. Great view from the room and pools to a river and snow covered hills.Definitely relaxing. Had a corner suite on floor 4 , 425, and only thing i did not like ( i didn't ask , so my fault ) was only 1 toilet for 4 occupants. Bathroom and toilet are separate, but still , having 2 would be more beneficial. So, for family of 4 , suggest to take joined rooms instead. Suite was furnished very nice, comfy beds, 2 big screen TV's, but somehow limited choice of programs. Parking indoor and outdoor, since indoor is charged 5e/day, me being cheapo parked outside :-)And bring a bathrobe for kids under 15, or you will pay 5e extra- have no idea why, since adult robes were supplied free. Very fast WIFI.Anyway, will be coming back. p.s. if you visit, enroll to thermana loyalty club, it can bring great savings.;Thermana Park Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceThermanaParkLasko;Zdravilishka cesta 6, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1616546;15.2320868

It was quite crowded, but that was not a Problem (it was hot, so everyone searches for water and for sure it is crowded ;)).In my opinion this must have been a very nice place in the past, cause you see the Age everywhere.We recognized that it has not been cleaned very much, you saw on every glass those stains and also the Silicone parts were very messy and far away from White.Also the Dressing room was messy. (even the ceiling already lost some parts!).For the Price of a high class thermana we expected much more. We will not come here in the future again, the Price (9€ for 3 hours) is not worth the visit. The only cheap thing was the Beer in the bar in the outside area (2,50€ for 0,5L) but it was Lasko =) But the Price doesnt makes the taste better.We have been just in the pool area, so we cant say anything about the Sauna Area.";Thermana Park Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceThermanaParkLasko;Zdravilishka cesta 6, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1616546;15.2320868

Like a huge airport lounge with a pool;3;7.01.2015;Im writing on my last day here from my modern minimalist room as the hotel closed down the pools for technical reasons! And there is not much left to do. The hotel itself is like one giant airport lounge, too much glass for my taste, too little entertainment, zero sports facilities except a gym. Saunas are decent but cost extra and on top there is a all nude all sex rule. Not my cup of tea. Pools are great when they work and are not fully packed with people, on our first.day it was so crowded you couldn't swim at all. Food is average, service the poorest ever, how hard is it to remember that we need 3 towels for 3 persons. All in all one of the poorest spa experiences ever and will never come back and will make sure to spread the word!

Awesome hotel;5;15.09.2014;This is my fourth or fifth time stay in this hotel and it's still delivering full relaxation as well as outstanding service. Hotel is new, modern, clean and very interesting. Complex of pools is very original and big, indoor pools, outdoor pools, terrace pool, slides, etc. They have all kinds of aroma therapies, massages and that kind of service but I didn't try that. Check in and reception service is very professional, fast and kind. Rooms are big, free hi speed wi-fi, nice tv with more than enough channels in all languages. Nice balcony, nice furniture, very nice bathroom. Bed is just great and the sleep is perfect. Some little things are missing though, there's no coffee & tea making facilities in room, no regular soap, lotion and body milk, just built-in holders for liquid soap on the wall and for the shower gel in the shower, it's not that of a cost so I see them fixing it in the future. Food here is very very nice, starting with generous breakfast with all you can imagine, fresh pancakes, all sorts of salami, bacon, eggs, pastry, organic, vegan, bio, you name it they have it. Sandwiches and burgers down at the bar are also great, big and tasteful. Nice conference rooms if you're on business trip. Laško is very small and quiet town next to the city of Celje, it a short drive to the city so if you travel to Celje better stay here in Laško you won't mistake with this service and facilities they offer.;Thermana Park Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceThermanaParkLasko;Zdravilishka cesta 6, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1616546;15.2320868

The breakfast is great, with a lot to choose. Dinner looks great, but is really dull. All tastes the same. Housekeeping had the day off I think, because she never made it to our room. And when I asked for her while we were on the pool, they just threw a couple fresh towels in the room, without touching anything else. Not 4 star like at all. We booked the \comfort\"" room with river view and it really could have been a lot cleaner. I don't wanna know what the other rooms looked like. If you wanna sleep you have to upgrade to river view.

Excellent hotel;5;11.09.2013;I stayed twice at this hotel in 2011 and this year and will stay every next time I come to Laško or Celje. This is how hotel should be. I don't know why this hotel doesn't have 5 stars because you can't find one thing that is missing for it to be 5 star hotel. Spacious rooms, very modern, 60+ tv channels, great bathrooms with excellent showers (some with glass between room), great and modern halls, transparent fast elevators, great lobby, very very friendly staff, wi-fi for free all around hotel and in rooms, high speed connection no need for password. Bathroom and room amenities at high standard, bath robes, slippers, sawing kit, laundry bags, all kinds of soaps and shampoos, mini bar, great room service and so on. Pools are story for itself, you will not find this kind of water features at one place, terrace pool above the river, heated pools outside, indoor pools on many levels, big big dome that opens like those big telescopes in Chile. The bridge over river and the nature on the other side is beyond words, Slovenia is truly eco friendly- nature country and this place is one of the best in Slovenia. Laško is nice town, very near city of Celje so if you come to Celje do not bother finding city hotels book this one and enjoy! Food is great also, breakfast for vegans, those who watch weight, many meats and cheeses, espresso coffee... Bar is also great, on the river bank, nice food and great cocktails and service. Half board is a bit pricey but not that much, it's worth every euro spent.;Thermana Park Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceThermanaParkLasko;Zdravilishka cesta 6, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1616546;15.2320868
mixed emotions;4;18.08.2013;This is new hotel, built in 2008. It is very, very clean and modern. The food is good and the pools are excellent. There is even a small restaurant in the pool area with good affordable menus. It is a lot of fun and especially if you have children, which we do not. The rooms are spacious, clean and very modern. The hotel it self is located in one of nicest parts of Slovenia. The nature there is beyond beauty. Hills, rivers, castles etc. There is walking distance to Lasko and Celje old town is near by and it is must! But. We payed extra 2 euros for the room with a view, big mistake. You are asked not to open the windows or the doors if there is light in the room on? Why? Spiders. Giant, ugly, spiders, killed 4 during 3 night stay. The hotel knows of this problem, and said they are sorry but should not charge extra, for spiders and flying bugs. Also, and this is one and only time we encounter this issue, they charge 5 euros per night for parking. There is open, free parking but if you want your car protected from the heat etc. the hotel garage is 5 euros. We came to Lasko from 5 star resort in Portoroz where we did not pay for parking so...Overall, it is nice. I do not know about wellness seemed bit expensive compering to other spas in Slovenia.;Thermana Park Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceThermanaParkLasko;Zdravilishka cesta 6, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1616546;15.2320868

Great accomodation, fun hotel. Area a bit boring.;4;17.07.2013;If I had to revise the hotel by itself, it actually was a fun hotel. Great swimming pools, inside and outside. And maybe we were early in the season, but it wasn't too busy. So that makes it extra fun.The half-board formula was also super. The offer in food in the morning was more or less always the same, but there was lots of variety, you could plan it to eat different every day yourself. Dinner in the evening also had a lot to offer, with new and local choices every day. Lot's of fresh clean fruit daily (morning and evening). But also (less healthy) yummy desserts. Defenitely splendid for the price you pay.Just outside the hotel there was not a lot to do.So if you want a quiet holiday at the pool, highly recommended !(There is also welness facilities, but we did not make use of them);Thermana Park Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceThermanaParkLasko;Zdravilishka cesta 6, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1616546;15.2320868
Why 4*?;5;23.06.2013;I have been there for three days and I regret why did not stayed more. Great hotel but just 4*, and I don't know why, while have by my belief everything for 5*. My reccomendation is to ask a room with the view at the river Savinja. Great pools, great service and various offer of wellness services. It is great for families because there are a lot of kids pools and playground areas. I also suggest to visit Lasko brewery. Great. If anybody from this hotels ever read this - just keep up the good work, and thank you for lovely three days.;Thermana Park Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceThermanaParkLasko;Zdravilishka cesta 6, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1616546;15.2320868
Great hotel, very good spa;4;4.06.2013;We stayed here 4 days during Easter holidays with two small children. The hotel is really excellent, could easily be rated as a 5*. It has all you need: garage, kind personnel, large, modern and clean rooms, a few playgrounds for children, excellent buffet choice for breakfast and dinner, a piano bar, nice terrace with river view, 4 elevators...The spa area is not as big as we expected (we had previous experience from Terme Catez), but the given space is really well organized. Children's pool (not the safest place, though!), pool with artificial waves and another one inside, accompanied by three large jacuzzi baths. And a connected outside pool with slides. There is a restaurant upstairs to have a quick lunch.What we did not like was too many people, mostly locals (probably because of the holidays). Although the daily ticket is not cheap (15 euro), it was too crowded all the time, except early morning and late evening.And another really beautiful thing is a town park, next to the hotel, spreding along the river Savinja. We took long walks every evening, enjoyed the scenery, sculptures and green green nature. At the end of the park is a famous Lasko brewery :-)All in all, it was definitely worth going there, we had a really great time!;Thermana Park Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceThermanaParkLasko;Zdravilishka cesta 6, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1616546;15.2320868
Excellent hotel in idyllic Slovenian town;5;10.04.2013;Excellent hotel and good value for the money! Hotel is recently built, so everything is in great condition. Stuff is very pleasant and helpful. Breakfast and dinner are good and pretty standard for better European 4-star hotels. Location is easy to find, but could be better since hotel is situated between main road and river. River view is nice, but main road can be problematic for some people, despite the fact it is not traffic crowded at all. In general, environment is modestly noisy. Lasko is cute and peaceful little Slovenian town, ideal for rest and totally relaxing vacation, but if you expect some additional activities you should better choose some bigger tourist location in Slovenia. I will definitely come again to this place and can recommend it.;Thermana Park Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceThermanaParkLasko;Zdravilishka cesta 6, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1616546;15.2320868

The temperature in the bathroom was ideally.Restaurant is very good one, clean with very well prepared waiters and very good food and drinks.But... the strongest point in my opinion is the spa with lots of pools, jacuzzi and saunas.In sauna are the same rules like in Austria: naked and towel. What is very good in my opinion even the spa space is huge everywhere is very clean. I not recommend for singles or for people who like to swim; somehow is difficult to swim because all the inside pools have different curves. I didn't use the outside pool because it were few plus degrees. But for families with children is the perfect option: lot of pools,water toboggans and jacuzzi.Good point for staff which was very helpful and rapidly in the check in and check out time, services at the restaurant and spa.";Thermana Park Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceThermanaParkLasko;Zdravilishka cesta 6, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1616546;15.2320868

But be ware if you don't like crowds (like I do), don't go to a treatment. Also, ppl from the pool area will come in their swimsuits and talk loudy in the relaxation area. So, in all fariness the pool is noisy because of kids, the saunas are not rraditional saunas but what you would expect becuase they are connected with the pool. It's a great place to go, I lvoe the design oh the pool area, but not the most relaxing thing ever.The rooms are nice, quite new and a tad on the expensive side, but great if you have allergies with leather sofa's no carpets etc (at least the suite we had).;Thermana Park Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceThermanaParkLasko;Zdravilishka cesta 6, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1616546;15.2320868
Child Friendly;3;12.09.2012;The Park is situated in the center of the city of Laško and it's easy to find. The parking facilities are under ground and are charged 2€ (first 30 min free). From the parking lot a lift takes you to the lobby of the Park. You don't get a bathrobe or a towel so bring your own.The pools are large, there are two indoor and two outdoor for small children and three waterslides. With all that the Park is boring. You cannot sleep in or out because of the noise, and you have nothing to do in the pools. There is one with fake waves wich they turned on 2 times in the whole day for 10 minutes. They have a Restaurant on the 1st floor but you can only choose from pizza and mexican food. The lift that takes you up to it was out of service (it looked like it was out of service in a while because of the filth on the doors), so disabled persons could not get up to eat in the Restaurant. Also the prices weren't great. There is a lot of glass surfaces around the pools trough wich you cannot see because they have not been cleaned in a while. The cleaning lady passed in front of us a few times and wanted us to move. I can even say that she behaved like they paid us to be here not other way around.When we were leaving the device at the exit ate my bracelet any I couldn't get out.

Great weekend getaway;5;10.09.2012;The room was great, it had everything we need, it's also like new and very esthetic. The food was great, breakfast and dinner were varied. Pools - inside and outside - great. Free fitness - lovely. Celje is near - Citycenter - great mall (restaurant Pomaranèa in there is must try!). Nearby is a lot of walking and cycling routes and a lovely park. Everything is very relaxing, we will be back, for sure.;Thermana Park Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceThermanaParkLasko;Zdravilishka cesta 6, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1616546;15.2320868
wellness for the family;5;20.08.2012;This was our second stay at Welness Park Lasko. Our kids insisted on returning here and we, the parents, didn't need convincing. Actually, loving the discovery of new places, we never return to the same hotel again. Here's the only exception up to now.What makes this place great? The Wellness Park combines pools, jacuzzi's, all kinds of saunas, waterslides, .... It's directly accessible from the hotel (in your hotel bathrobe with hotel towels). The place is an intelligent mix between water amusement park and a termal center. The choice of sauna's is important but we recommend attending the programmed sauna sessions. Turkish bath with chocolate, Aloe Vera Finish Whirling sauna, ... HeavenlyThe rooms are spacious and very comfortable for a family of four. The bathroom is large and very well equiped. Airconditioning is welcome on hot days (and it can get very hot).Wifi is available in the rooms. The Wifi speed is good for regular use, not for streaming.The room has a nice terras with view on the river and the mount Hum.Breakfast and diner buffet are of good quality and offer a good variation.Our deal included also free use of nordics walking sticks and mountain bikes and a visit to the local brewery. Local hiking and bike trails are well documented.The animation programme is OK altough we didn't attend much of the events. Too much other things to do. We recommend staying in Lasko during the Beer and Flowers festival beginning of July. The village has several days of parties and event for every one. And the beer is quite good.Staff is very friendly and do their very best to make your stay as pleasantly as possible.During our second stay we noticed that the number of visitor had increased. Besides some inconviences (queus at the programmed sauna session, traffic at the breakfast and diner buffet, underground parking is no longer free) the quality of service remains very high.One opportunity of improvement (in case the hotel management reads this) is the use of other languages than Slovenian. Translating poolside and sauna animation and the most of the communication into another language (German, English, ..) would be welcome.;Thermana Park Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceThermanaParkLasko;Zdravilishka cesta 6, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1616546;15.2320868
A good place to spend your time with the family;4;5.07.2012;Wellness Park Lasko is a thermal bath, modernized with EU funds. The place it is looking well for a wellness park but in my opinion is more an aquatic park then a wellness. They have also a spa, very cold and unfriendly. I tried a massage (at 9 am)... It was done to be done. Nothing special, nothing to be remembered. Try it in a week end.;Thermana Park Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceThermanaParkLasko;Zdravilishka cesta 6, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1616546;15.2320868
Wellness place;4;20.01.2012;It's a new hotel, everything was very clean (what is the most important thing to me). The stuff was very kind and helpfull. It has a big pool with a jacuzzi. It's better to go at the pool after 6 pm, because it is not crowded like in the morning and afternoon.40 minutes away by car is Golte (good place if you want to ski). The breakfast was very good, but for the dinner you had a lot of different food but it wasn't much tasty.;Thermana Park Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceThermanaParkLasko;Zdravilishka cesta 6, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1616546;15.2320868
Hotel with nice staff, planty SPA possibilitys and fantastic hotel for athlets;4;15.12.2011;This is new modern hotel, with all facilitys you can imagine (inside and outside pools, thermal water, savnas- whatever you want, fitnes, wellnes,.....kongres, meeting and massage rooms,....everything.Rooms are nice, comfortable, clean. Restaurant food could be on higer level but you still can go in A la carte Restaurant.They offer really a lot for a very reasonable price. Hotel is in small town Laško, near biger town Celje. You can reach Celje from hotel by bus, train, taxi (it´s only 10 min drive).Hotel has great position for all guests who loves mountains, mountain hiking, walking by the river Savinja or discover old romans time around Laško and Celje (in Celje can discover Under the Town with Romans- arheologic discovery or on Celje and Laško Castle).Hotel it´s self is fantastic for young couples, family, romantic diner with massage or jacuzzi.

Odlican/Excellent;5;9.12.2011;Hotel je sjajan, moderan, jako uredan. Bazen je odlican, veliki je, dovoljan i za decu i za odrasle. Malo je veca guzva vikendom, ali to je normalno. Hrana je takodje odlicna, veliki izbor i za dorucak i za veceru.Sigurno cu ponovo otici.The hotel is great, modern, very neat. The pool is excellent, big, enough for both children and adults. It is more crowded on weekends, but this is normal. The food is also excellent, a great choice for breakfast and for dinner.I will certainly go again.;Thermana Park Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceThermanaParkLasko;Zdravilishka cesta 6, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1616546;15.2320868
It is all about health;5;11.08.2011;"Becouse of my problems with lower back (hernia discus), and becouse my friends liked it here i gave it a try. me and my girlfriend stayed here for a 10 days and i must say i was amaized, not becouse of the food or the rooms, but becouse of the experience. Thermal water and therapy helped me to ease my pain in just a week. dispite the fact that it did cost me a little bit more, but afterall what wouldnt we do for our health? They have doctors here and they subscribed me therapies that realy helped me. Staff is friendly, massage therapists are experts. They know what they are doing, all of them have years of experience, you realy feel the difference between them and other commercial spas. There is a railroad passing near so it maight get disturbing. in that case just change the room for \riverwiew\"" like i did, for a small fee ofcourse, but the peace on that side is worht paying for. one more thing, there is a brewery near open for visits – quality beer i must say. if you get bored there is a bigger town Celje only 10 km away - bigger choice of nightlife and you can get there by train.""";Thermana Park Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceThermanaParkLasko;Zdravilishka cesta 6, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1616546;15.2320868
Plenty of room for improvements;2;30.01.2011;My boyfriend and me have spent last weekend at Wellness Park Lasko and in many respects it hasn't fulfilled our expectations.We have booked a double room superior (= river view) and it was quite spacious and comfortable. Wifi connection in rooms was very slow.The concept and style of the whole hotel is modern and minimalistic, but it looks quite cheap, especially the restaurant. Food actually is the weakest point: brekfast has a level of an average 3* hotel, but dinner was very poor, food tassteless, with little variety and no creativity at all.Wellness/pool and Spa zone has often been too crowded but it was due to weekend and many locals came to spend a day at pool with children.The idea of having inside and outside part of the pool connected is quite original, but for something like that the water was way too cold. We have been at some other hotels with the same pool plan and staying outside was pleasant while here it was freezing.You needed to bring your own towel to go to sauna, or take one from your room and they were too small. I have asked at Spa reception if we may have additional towels - yes, charged 2,50 EUR each!Hotel strongest point - at least out of services I have tried out - is Thai massage. The staff is nice and professional, and I've had one of the best massages ever, even better than in Thailand.;Thermana Park Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceThermanaParkLasko;Zdravilishka cesta 6, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1616546;15.2320868
The best wellness hotel in Slovenia;5;14.12.2010;We have been to quite a few wellness hotels- spas in Slovenia but Wellness Park Hotel in Laško is definitely something special. The hotel is very nice, modern, with spacious rooms, the restaurant served excellent breakfast and good dinner. A special lift takes you right from your room to the wellness and spa center which is the best part of the hotel. It is huge, the saunas are very clean and spacious, there is a very big whirlpool (fits more than 10 people) which extends to an equally big outdoor whirlpool with view of the green forest! Unforgettable. The swimming pools are also unique, you can also swim out to the outdoor pool or even enjoy real waves in a special section. The staff is extremely helpful, all demands are responded to with a smile, you really feel welcome. In the vicinity (about 8 km away) is a restaurant you should not miss- it serves excellent Slovenian food with a touch of haute cuisine!- It is called Francl!;Thermana Park Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceThermanaParkLasko;Zdravilishka cesta 6, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1616546;15.2320868
Perfect walk-bike-and-relax type amidst postcard landscape, but they let you pay.;3;15.08.2010;"We found this place just convenient to fulfill our needs of a comfortable hotel with plenty of water fun surrounded by walking paths and nearby trip activities. The slopes of the hills all around are really steep, but you get the best rewards for your sweat - huge poster-like views. Not suitable for children under 5, as the peaks are too high and far, bud older ones manage it. The hotel has its private bridge over Savinja, by which one can reach a nerby water spring! Fairly small walking distance to railway station -train trips to Celje, Ljub., Ptuj, etc. possible. If you arrive by train, hotel staff arranges taxi from station on arrival and departure - for free- otherwise you pay for everything - for example: the halfboard did not include water and juice for dinner, we also had to pay extra for \presents\"" as wellness procedures (you get just a minimal discount for one single procedure) or some animation programme (brewery excursion), which should have been included in the price. Dinners rich with good choice of meats and delicious dumplings but vegetables such as tomatoes too raw, and deserts rather pour. Pleasant and caring restaurant and room staff. Too thick pillows, air condition inefficient in hot days. elsewhere room comfort very good.""";Thermana Park Lasko;Slovenija;Spa;SlovenijaTopliceThermanaParkLasko;Zdravilishka cesta 6, Lasko 3270, Slovenia;46.1616546;15.2320868
